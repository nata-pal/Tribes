You can thank David Miscavige if you got the overall impression Scientology itself is weird.  The fifty letters from the Church and its lawyers to the BBC  that the church brags about in its counter video promised litigation should those secrets be told .  In other words, spend parishioner donations to cover Dave&#8217;s ass exclusively, forcing the media to fill in with old hat, more generalized attack material.  Protect Miscavige at the expense of Scientology.   </p> <p>The show does give credible accounts from Mike, Amy, Marc, Claire, Jason, Mareka, et al on matters the world ought to know.  But, the secrets that were touted and would have had the most salutory effects were left on the editing room floor.</p> <p>In that respect, I admit I was wrong. I earlier suggested the BBC would be less inclined to back off as I had accused U.S. media of doing (since the BBC is publicly funded).   At the end of the day, I remain confident that the &#8216;save Dave at any expense&#8217;

I just never moved on the Bridge during my 22-year stay there even though I worked my butt off. The number of people posted to audit the crew was never NEAR any proper amount to get the int base crew up the Bridge&#8211;they mostly did select execs or favorites. Just recruit them, promise them all the things LRH says SO members are to receive, and tough if they never get it. I finally realized I would never get much or any auditing if I stayed there, and neither would 99% of the rest of the crew. I found out about the violence well after I left. I stayed that long partially due to dedication, and one of  the other reasons was the entire crew was being lied to in &#8220;briefings&#8221; about how straight up and vertical our expansion was. So I thought I was accomplishing something for others at least. Just wanted to give you another viewpoint of even more crap that goes on there. There are even more reasons to leave!</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52411"> 		<div id="comment-52411"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/357a20e8c56e69d6f9734d23ef9517e8?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">brendon</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52411"> 				September 29, 2010 at 3:57 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52411#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52411", "52411", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to brendon'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I had the same reaction.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52413"> 		<div id="comment-52413"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2b586e533d59e47860691de2fc2a739f?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Mockingbird6</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52413"> 				September 29, 2010 at 4:05 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52413#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52413", "52413", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Mockingbird6'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>That was my first thought.

For example, in the 17th century, Leibniz arrived at an explanation of reality that includes a source of force called a &#8220;monad&#8221;.

For the bulk of the population this is a pretty powerful piece. The section on OT III was juvenile trash, but what can we expect from a media outfit having to deal with juvenile trash like Tommy &#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything no matter how immoral to suck up to David Miscavige&#8221; Davis, and their army of uber-creepy PIs trying to push in anchor points by flooding them with video cameras?  </p> <p>Like you said Marty, it&#8217;s Miscavige: ALWAYS ready to throw the entire religion and LRH under the nearest bus to &#8220;deny&#8221; his own guilt and thereby demonstrate it to the world. </p> <p>The show demonstrated that 1) the Church breaks up families, 2) the Church is run by liars, 3) the Church will go to any expense to discredit and harass media and any whistle blowers, 4) the Church uses covert surveillance, 5) David Miscavige &#8220;one of the greatest spiritual leaders of the 13th century&#8221; (or whatever) is a poster child for Profanity-R-Us, 6) the Church prefers abortions over children, 7) the Church shamelessly manipulates celebrities into being mouthpieces, 8) the Church uses Scientology in reverse to trigger critics into fits of hostility that they can video and use against them, 9) the Church secretly videos everyone who gets auditing from them, 10) the Church collects and uses blackmail material (just like J. Edgar Hoover) to control people.</p> <p>All the ex- and Independent Scientologists came off as sincere and completely believable unlike Church terminals who just came off as slime bags and liars.</p> <p>Overall, David Miscavige once again got out his primary message: &#8220;No one can stop us because we are more aggressive than anyone. I am the living embodiment of aggression.&#8221; </p> <p>The only problem is: aggression isn&#8217;t the solution to what ails this planet. It&#8217;s the problem. Thus Miscavige has dished out more of the worst marketing in the history of the human race.</p> <p>VWD to Mike, Marty, Mareka, Christie, Marc, Claire, Amy, Jason and Larry.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52450"> 		<div id="comment-52450"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/67b556af1015fc766800875e537f7902?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Mark Fisher</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52450"> 				September 29, 2010 at 7:17 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52450#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52450", "52450", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Mark Fisher'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Steve and Martin,  I completely agree with your assessments.

I thought that you and Mike put your case across very well and let people know that there IS a reformation movement within Scientology (no, I havent forgotten about the FreeZone, its just that they havent exactly commanded wide publicity up to now). Hopefully many current churchies will see this and start to wonder, Maybe I SHOULD re-examine where I am going in the CoS ?</p> <p>The Beeb will have been very aware that the CoS has deep pockets and will ruthlessly pursue opponents in the courts if given the slightest chance. They probably decided not to show anything that couldnt be proven 100%.</p> <p>For me, the most telling part, as it usually is, was the personal testimony of those who had been abused, especially these wonderfully brave women, Amy, Claire and Mareka. Only the most callous and stony-hearted could fail to be moved by hearing Mareka tell of the moment that her fiancé left her and see the pain in her tears. Im definitely a stiff upper lip sort of chap, but Im not ashamed to say that my eyes misted over then.</p> <p>This programme will be used as a reference for years to come and there is nothing that Miscavige and his legions of DMbots can do about it. Their demise is one step closer.</p> <p>Ax</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52352"> 		<div id="comment-52352"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4027ad85ade81da91c8062bb073dbca3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">OTDT</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52352"> 				September 28, 2010 at 11:53 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52352#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52352", "52352", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to OTDT'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Sweeney blew it by his violations of the precepts of the journalistic code that BBC and it&#8217;s governing bodies and culture hold in high esteem.

I know I could not have done what has been carried out here- many have withered under the attacks mounted by c of s in the past and though hopes weren&#8217;t realized with the BBC  show- look around, your closest friends may be reading the same things you are and wondering who it is safe to talk to about what they have read- I have had more than a few major surprises in the last month.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52368"> 		<div id="comment-52368"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0eeb1b216783ec43864a607a5dcf1f4f?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Tom</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52368"> 				September 29, 2010 at 12:48 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52368#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52368", "52368", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Tom'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think John Sweeny and the BBC did an incredibly artistic job of framing the controversies, and appreciate the contributions of all that participated.

I am sure there was a lot of material that was left on the cutting-room floor, either due to the BBC&#8217;s legal squeamishness or time constraints. But looking at it in a glass-half-full mode, the information that made it through is damaging enough.

That is so, so creepy it&#8217;ll turn off most anyone who watches the show.<br /> 2. Disconnection from family.  Not being able to talk to one&#8217;s sister in nearly 6 years!!  That will horrify people, big time.  Scratch off more people who WON&#8217;T be going in.<br /> 3. Coerced abortions.  What woman watching the show is going to go for that one?  None! Scratch off more people who won&#8217;t be going in.<br /> 4. Tommy Davis.  He comes off as so arrogant, nasty and mean-spirited.  That in itself will turn people away.  Oh and his mother, yuk!  She came off as haggard and very hostile.<br /> 5. Last but not least, the positive change in Mike&#8217;s appearance since he left the CofM.  A blind man could see it with his cane!  You think people are going to say, gee I want to be like him before he left.  Not. </p> <p>To all involved in the making of this show, take a win.  You did a great job.

In part he said the following:</p> <p>&#8220;I think the programme, although hard hitting, missed some essential elements. It spent valuable time trying to justify the previous programme when it could have dug deeper into the despot at the ship&#8217;s helm and how he managed to re-create Scientology in his own image, which is why good people like yourselves had to leave. It also didn&#8217;t try to explain why you still follow the teachings despite escaping the Church&#8217;s tendrils. That would have described a fuller picture and not risked coming over as a damnation of a so-called brainwashing cult.&#8221;</p> <p>I think he summed it up well.</p> <p>Having said that Mareka has already had 15 emails from the UK and only one was negative (a current Birmingham org staff member complaining they now have to handle the flap with their parents). The other 14 were supportive and congratulatory &#8212; note none are from current Independents.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52553"> 		<div id="comment-52553"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e03548f1e9f27ed544b10639c6815420?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">SK</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52553"> 				September 29, 2010 at 4:16 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52553#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52553", "52553", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to SK'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Haydn, thanks for briefing us on this letter from your friend.

Thanks so much for posting it here so we all could see it.  I expected much more of a comm lag.  I know it must be frustrating dealing with the editing, but alot of good points were made.  I liked that Sweeney made a point of mentioning that Mike and others still believe in Scientology. It&#8217;s the Church&#8217;s actions they oppose.  That was great.<br /> I absolutely love that the Auditor in you always comes out.  Sweeney saw that Scientology works in that moment. Fantastic. Very big deal for that guy.<br /> I also thought that you and Mike did a great thing for Sweeney by showing what was done to him with the buttons. And also Mike confirming that he wasn&#8217;t paranoid, he was being followed back in 2007.  Showed how the Church operates and also helped Sweeney as a being. Very cool.<br /> Disconnection was talked about loud and clear.  Thank you Mareka. You also did a wonderful job and that was very brave.  I&#8217;m so sorry about your fiancee.<br /> Through Amy and Jason people saw the outpoint of private information being communicated to the public if you speak out against the church.<br /> We all probably have a wish list of what else we would have liked included.

I do see Martys point on not nailing Miscavage more, but I do think that enough was shown to expose that current management is off the rails. The before and after of Mike Rinder is enough to make people see something was clearly wrong back when he was still in.   Also, Tommy Davis is just a total messhe looks like a complete madman.</p> <p>The meter Demo was excellent and cast a very positive picture of how it works, and also a hint on how it could be used against a person. I loved seeing the part of the LRH interview (introduction to Scientology) and the pictures of students at Saint Hill. I think that segment of the interview showed a happier time in Scientology.. Then later on in the program showing segments of the crazy Orientation Film; the OT III segment; confidential session data being recorded and in some cases released; and disconnection from family, clearly painting a different picture on how things are now under the current Management.  I think these points will hit home to anyone on the fence.   </p> <p>Thanks again to all those who stuck their neck out.

Once again the cult has proven they could hang themselves with a shoelace.  Apparently it also holds the worlds record on foot-bullet marksmanship.  And if the cult had no bad luck, theyd have no luck at all.  </p> <p>The Panorama program offered its viewers a clear view of:</p> <p>1.  The malleable cult celebrities who are coached to ask rhetorical questions that arent the least bit rhetorical, e.g., Anne Archer&#8217;s faux furious snarl, &#8220;Do I look brainwashed to you?&#8221;  (Cringe!)</p> <p>2.  Cathy Rinder&#8217;s over-the-top shriekage, a dramatic contrast with her demure matron in the second row image on Anderson Cooper 360.   Those two images beg someone, anyone, please, to overlay her AC360 video footage with Sweeneys phone recordings of her foul and hateful language.  </p> <p>3.  The regimentation and depersonalization of todays Sea Org.</p> <p>4.  The cults obsession with respectability and property portfolio (love that term).  </p> <p>5.  The relentless and arrogant harassment of those who found the courage to leave a cult they had joined as children to regain their sanity and freedom.  </p> <p>6.  The idiocy of confiding ANYTHING to an auditor or any other agent of the current-day Church of Scientology.</p> <p>7.  The homophobic and sadistic sexual obsessions of the self-anointed Pope of Scientology  David Miscavige.  </p> <p>Happily, the program also demonstrated:  </p> <p>1.  The difference that three years away from RPF imprisonment can make  in Mike, who is so much happier, brighter, healthier and relaxed than he was in 2007.  </p> <p>2.  The contrast between Tommy Daviss and Jan Eastgates covert hostility and the normal human affection and communication available from Marty, Amy, Mike, Claire, Marc, Jason.   </p> <p>3.  The high personal integrity and courage of every one of the Independent Scientologists and critics!  </p> <p>4.  The simple fact that Scientology philosophy and practices are valued and applied to good effect outside the cult. </p> <p>Tonight, the Internet is immensely more powerful than the cults lies.  Any Secrets of Scientology not imparted through the Panorama program can be shared on this and other blogs.  Starting tomorrow, each of us can choose to start more conversations with loved ones and friends.  In those conversations, gradients and ARC apply, and active listening beats the hell out of sermonizing.  I had one of those conversations earlier this week.  The evidence against the cult is everywhere and will be seen when people choose to look.  </p> <p>I no longer wonder about when the cult will topple.  I dont worry about its beautiful, empty buildings or its billions of dollars hidden in offshore bank accounts or David Miscaviges tight grip on the churchs throat  nothing can prop it up.  The Church of Scientology is stone cold dead.  </p> <p>If Scientology survives, and I believe it will, it will do so in the sunshine, shared spontaneously among friends and disseminated freely on the Internet  not doled out as bait or sold as statuses or indulgences.  </p> <p>Thank you to everyone who contributed to this program.  I appreciate your efforts very much.  Everything will turn out fine.    </p> <p>Just Me</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-mrinder odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52482"> 		<div id="comment-52482"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ab01b94a5e488af57abff572315e5487?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">mrinder</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52482"> 				September 29, 2010 at 10:14 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52482#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52482", "52482", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to mrinder'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks JM.

It opened the door to truth&#8230;and let some sunshine in.</p> <p>I wish the report included more about the Fair Gaming and destruction of the lives of people they consider &#8216;critics&#8217;. This report exposed just some of the tactics OSA does. (videotaping, harrassing, following, bullbaiting, Black PR&#8230;etc.) A special report on these tactics and how they go about doing this&#8230;more specific details, seems to be important information to expose too.</p> <p>I think it is well done nevertheless! Nothing to be discouraged about. We humanbeings have what is known as a &#8216;Slide Effect&#8217; of our minds&#8230;given too much heavy and/or shocking information, we will shut down or lose interest and turn to something more simple. Sweeney had to create something for a broad range of people who are NOT Scientologists and who may know very little about the subject. Perhaps hitting his audience too hard with ALL the facts would not have been the best thing in this respect. </p> <p>I was fascinated with the mini &#8216;auditing&#8217; &amp; demonstration of the e-meter, Marty. Real auditing, done with confidentiality, ethics and compassion, is still the very best type of counseling one could participate in! It DOES work when done right, with an auditor who is well trained and has his own ethics *in*. I can certainly attest to that!</p> <p>Don&#8217;t let your hearts be discouraged that all was not said in the one hour Mr. Sweeney had to reveal it. That would NOT have been enough time anyway. I have a funny &#8216;feeling&#8217; that the heavier &#8216;secrets&#8217; that you might think were left on the cutting room floor&#8230;may actually be being edited at this very moment, to be used in the sequel to this first real expose&#8217;. </p> <p>I say all this, but I am still sad tonight&#8230;just seeing people behave so poorly, without a conscience&#8230;without class and in such a criminal manner as OSA does&#8230;the destructive hurtful things they have done&#8230;the absolute EVIL&#8230;it is heartbreaking. They are not defending real Scientology&#8230;they are defending themselves from exposure&#8230;most of the people in the church are innocent and good people&#8230;unassuming and unaware of all the destructive/criminal things that are done in the name of Scientology by these few. The shame is&#8230;it is the actions of the few&#8230;the evil minions and OSA at the behest of  &#8216;certain others&#8217; &#8230;that is sullying the name of a once amazing knowledge, philosophy&#8230;and religion that real Scientology is&#8230;</p> <p>Critics have no power over TRUTH and good and right things&#8230;So why is OSA, et al;  so afraid of a critic or two&#8230;or even 100?&#8230;If they were doing nothing wrong? What would they care&#8230;if it were not true? In this case a critic would have no effect at all&#8230;if there was nothing to expose.  </p> <p>The are seeing &#8216;enemies&#8217; everywhere. Doing evil to people who simply have a difference of opinion. When you watch the way OSAbots follow and video their &#8216;enemies&#8217;&#8230;it looks almost like the ridiculous follies of the &#8216;keystone cops&#8217;&#8230;if only what they do wasn&#8217;t also so evil and heinous&#8230;if their purpose for existance wasn&#8217;t to set about looking for and creating &#8216;enemies&#8217; of mere people everywhere for saying the wrong thing to the wrong person at the wrong time&#8230;and taking it all wrong!&#8230;</p> <p>S.O.S.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52463"> 		<div id="comment-52463"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/893aaa901b2a869fcf49f953170c230c?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Jane</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52463"> 				September 29, 2010 at 8:22 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52463#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52463", "52463", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Jane'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>You&#8217;re so right about the &#8216;slide effect&#8217;.

If I were a non-Scientologist watching this program, I would get the idea that there might be something to the subject of Scientology but the organization is very, very sinister. It appears they will lure you in with smiles, get you to open up to them, take your money, and then use your secrets and any other leverage they have against you if you decide to speak up because you don&#8217;t like the way things are going.  If I were a non-Scientologist seeing this program, it would make me want to stay the hell away from that organization. To that degree, the program is a huge success.

It would just be an interesting tidbit.</p> <p>Sure, I&#8217;m sorry they caved on even spending a few minutes detailing it, but I think the story did the greatest good for the greatest number of people.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52416"> 		<div id="comment-52416"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2b586e533d59e47860691de2fc2a739f?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Mockingbird6</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52416"> 				September 29, 2010 at 4:11 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52416#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52416", "52416", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Mockingbird6'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I liked the way the new movement was labeled the Reformation; though I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m ready yet for it to be called that, the taste of how it sounded was helpful.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52417"> 		<div id="comment-52417"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7d1f0a386f77f912132f803b85d63f30?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Dean Blair</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52417"> 				September 29, 2010 at 4:34 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52417#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52417", "52417", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Dean Blair'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I very much enjoyed the presentation.

I was shocked to find this out and wondered how many other major (or minor for that matter) cities have NOT run exposés due to OSA interference.

WTFgross and disgusting and surely viewed as slimy in ANY circles.<br /> Marty, maybe the secrets you told werent included, but there were secrets that CofM does not want parishioners to know revealed. I was shocked by a lot of this stuff because I havent read everybodys books yet or all the stuff on the web. So without much of that info, it seemed like a lot of secrets of the CofM were revealed.<br /> IMO if a person who knew nothing of LRH came across this video, there was enough to stop them from walking into a CofM but not enough to stop them from looking for Independents to learn about LRH instead. This is a GREAT thing!<br /> I am biased, of course, but Im also deeply immersed in the greenfield.<br /> Mike, you look like you got the bring back to life process run on ya. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-wink' title=';)'>;)</span> Marty, youre looking quite dashing (and soooooo much better than your swimming pool days of white particularly)!<br /> The family portraits were touching and heartbreaking, especially to me, a mother, sister and step-grannyI was in tears over their losses.</p> <p>So again, VWD to all of you!</p> <p>Martin, awesome getting on the air! You came across well and thanks for the props to LRH.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52457"> 		<div id="comment-52457"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fb490a83d05b4fc4b31a47523269d3b3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Tara</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52457"> 				September 29, 2010 at 7:57 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52457#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52457", "52457", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Tara'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Church of Scientology executives admit that its own members choose of their own volition to cut all ties with their children, cut all ties with their grandchildren, cut all ties with their sisters and brothers and cut all ties with their friends.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52532"> 		<div id="comment-52532"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fb490a83d05b4fc4b31a47523269d3b3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Tara</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52532"> 				September 29, 2010 at 3:33 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52532#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52532", "52532", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Tara'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I am practicing the spin like the CofM uses, taking things out of context.<br /> I do think &#8220;parishioners&#8221; should be held accountable for cutting off communication to their families though.

In Belgium, where I&#8217;m from, scientology is considered to be a cult. I thought the program was great, but it felt like an &#8216;introduction&#8217; more than a complete in depth look. It looked as if the cos warrants a whole series rather than a one hour program. In any case, to me, John Sweeney showed very clearly to steer clear of this church but at the same time was open to your beliefs. The celebrities looked like total idiots and so did Tommy Davies.<br /> The Headley&#8217;s story is very moving and I wish them all the best. Their family situation is closest to my own and to live your life separate from your parents and siblings because of the cos policies is beyond comprehension.<br /> All in all, thumbs up!<br /> Marty and Mike, may you achieve your goals and live a happy life with your loved ones. Your courage is inspiring. Although I don&#8217;t share your beliefs, your personal stories have stopped me looking at scientology as something to be ridiculed but rather blame the church for its wrongdoings.<br /> PS. The demonstration of the e-meter on Panorama was definitely intriguing. But as I don&#8217;t want to end up on a cos mailing list, I will pass, may be until the church is reformed or dissolved.

Ok.  And I didn´t get the idea that the BBC and Panorama really care if the facts about Scientology are spelled out. Roger that.</p> <p>BUT&#8230;. I take a win, Marty. I loved the meter demo, your whole approach is positive and in comm, your smile is enchanting <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span>  Many have noted here how unwell Mike looked when shown clips from 2007 comparing to his good looks of today. Well this is very true for me. Do you know that it was one of my first alarms back in the early 2000´s when I observed both you and Mike look so unhappy and gray. The 2 man who had my most respect were sort of withering away in front of me. It was awful and left me deeply saddened.  And look at you now !! I take a personal big win on that.<br /> Mareka is just&#8230;sincere and superb. Go ahead, be my guest and dispute what she had to say. A thought of her going back on that memorylane, back when she said goodbye to her man, have me emotional. Thanks Mareka for sharing so personal moment.  Amy did great, as per usual.  AMY YOU ROCK!! </p> <p>In the contrast, those still hovering near DM and who you see and hear in this program acts as a repellent, makes you not want to reach for the subject. Their message: The church is practicing disconnection, use PI´s and lawyers to intimidate and harass, spell out and publish priest/penitent privileged information.  Anyone of them (Dear Leader, Tommy, the screaming ex´s and execs, celebs),  would in drop of a hat turn against you and pour shit all over you. And they are. And not just you but on LRH.  Shame on them. </p> <p>Mr. Sweeney gets a star from me.

You do need to step back and realize that although it didnt have the blood and crimes  many wanted to see, it DID effectively communicate the curent state of affairs regarding scientology.<br /> It did effectiviely communicate the worth of the subject matter and the absolute transformation that a person can undergo(YOU) when one leaves the suppresivness of the organization but maintains his viewpoint and integrity.  It visually showed millions what the E- Meter does and how the organization is destructive to families and critics.  And it was all done on a gradient the public could absorb and accept.  In was in itself a VFP for introducing people to the subject while warning them of the organizational dangers.  No malice, no hate.  Just some folks who still care about the subject and their fellow human beings.  Nice job.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52989"> 		<div id="comment-52989"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2fb4b1135fe28557060ab78b6f1f42b7?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://leavingscientology' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>OnceUponaTime</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52989"> 				October 1, 2010 at 1:47 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52989#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52989", "52989", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to OnceUponaTime'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Mike,</p> <p>Also, I&#8217;m betting that it&#8217;s easier to be in love with someone who&#8217;s free to express her/his personal integrity.

Reminds me of when I was the PCS of my org before joining the Sea Org and calling new public &#8220;Raw Meat.&#8221;</p> <p>Anyway, I thought the program was absolutely brilliant on so many levels. At first I thought it could be harder-hitting, but then realized that to someone watching this program who knew nothing about Scientology, will now walk away knowing a lot more than they did about the Church and what happens to dissenters or people who disagree &#8211; or even people who want to tell their side of the story. That person watching, unless completely delusional, will never set foot in a CoS ever.</p> <p>So what that the Xenu/OT III material was covered? It&#8217;s a big and major part of Scientology. I think people have the right to know what&#8217;s being sold. You may not think so, but I do.</p> <p>From RJ 67 LRH says: </p> <p>&#8220;The material involved in this sector is so vicious that it is carefully arranged to kill anyone if he discovers the exact truth of it.</p> <p>&#8220;So in January and February of this year, I became very ill, almost lost this body, and somehow or another brought it off and obtained the material, and was able to live through it. I am very sure that I was the first one that ever did live through any attempt to attain that material. This material<br /> I&#8217;m talking about, of course, is very upper level material and you will forgive me if I don&#8217;t describe it to you in very broad detail because it&#8217;s very likely to make you sick, too.</p> <p>&#8220;Now my task for the remainder of the year, up until now &#8211; which is to say the ensuing six months &#8211; was to find some way to safely bring through individuals. It was not enough for I myself to have lived through it. Other people would have to do so as well when they reached Clear and tried to move up from that point above.</p> <p>&#8220;And about five or six weeks ago, I finally was able to make a breakthrough which brought people through the zone safely. It is relatively easy to do now, provided one is an extremely well-trained auditor, and the band of fire can be walked through, bringing one out the other side unscathed, providing he applies the exact technology. No one is in danger of colliding with this at lower levels, since it concerns the formation of the society itself in which we live. A person is Clear on the first dynamic. It is necessary, to become OT, to became cleared on all dynamics, including that of society and that of the physical universe. So I have also made this breakthrough,<br /> and I don&#8217;t mind telling you, it took some doing. In all the eighteen years, this has been the toughest one that I have faced. And I faced it so that it would not be tough for you to face when you came to it.&#8221;</p> <p>You may think that the material is so out-reality for people who have not moved up to being at that level to comprehend it, or wrap their wits around it, or will get sick from being exposed to it. To those who believe that, I say you are completely underestimating and miscalculating the intelligence of common, everyday human beings. People also have the right to know what they&#8217;re buying, especially with a religious belief or subject with claims of this scope and magnitude, and thus form their own opinions and make their decisions based on that knowledge. </p> <p>I thought the pinch test was a great idea, however it&#8217;s also interesting that a new definition for what the E-Meter does was introduced by Marty- being a &#8220;truth detector.&#8221; Never heard that definition before. From what I know, all the meter really does as a device is measure resistance to the flow of current going through the body. Weather that is mental mass moving in or away, or a &#8220;body read,&#8221; all it is is a reaction to what&#8217;s happening to the flow of current. That&#8217;s it. Has nothing to do with detecting lies, or the opposite for that matter &#8211; thus making the meter itself a device of &#8220;evaluation for the pc.&#8221;</p> <p>Mike, Marty, Amy, Marc, Claire and Mareka, you all did a brilliant job to expose this dangerous Cult. It leaves this series open for further episodes IMO. You&#8217;ve got a very wide audience.</p> <p>And to Mike and Marty, I agree with others who have mentioned that just because the BBC didn&#8217;t cover a lot of the secrets you wanted exposed, you can still expose them. This blog is a great place to start. You have an audience.</p> <p>Major thumbs up!!!</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52625"> 		<div id="comment-52625"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e9c95c80e61c125066483f55d04581b6?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Valkov</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52625"> 				September 29, 2010 at 8:45 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52625#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52625", "52625", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Valkov'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Back in 1971,  my first auditor, a Class VIII,  referred to the E-meter as a &#8220;truth detector&#8221;

Unless your intent is to belittle, overwhelm or confuse the person.  And scare them away from ever studying the &#8220;scientific method&#8221; or &#8220;astrophysics&#8221;.</p> <p>As to OT III being a &#8220;major part of Scientology&#8221; &#8230; I&#8217;d say that it has its place of importance, sure (and that&#8217;s why LRH described it publicly as he did in RJ67). But the fact is, the Factors and Axioms are much more &#8220;major parts of Scientology&#8221;, and that even these don&#8217;t make much sense unless one first understands the basic books and lectures published in the 50s and 60s, before the full context or relative importance of OT III makes any sense at all.  </p> <p>If you&#8217;re afraid that &#8220;hiding a belief in entities&#8221; is a fraud and a no-no, I&#8217;d just point you to the lectures and books from the early 50s, where LRH openly discusses his views on &#8220;injected entities&#8221; and other entities in the make-up of a person.  &#8220;History of Man&#8221; comes to mind.</p> <p>This whole anti-Scn propaganda campaign to release OT III and try to belittle Scientologists and overwhelm and confuse people is just that &#8212; belittlement and propaganda.   And whether you agree with any of the data in OT III or not, I think you know enough about Scientology, the subject, to recognize that pretending that &#8220;little green martians&#8221; are the be-all and end-all of Scientology is pretty disingenuous.  In fact, it&#8217;s a lie.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-martyrathbun09 comment-author-is-site-member bypostauthor odd alt depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52710"> 		<div id="comment-52710"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c2d94d163a566268e73c8b0195b6c03a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">martyrathbun09</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52710"> 				September 30, 2010 at 5:06 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52710#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52710", "52710", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to martyrathbun09'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Nice post Margaret.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52993"> 		<div id="comment-52993"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2fb4b1135fe28557060ab78b6f1f42b7?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://leavingscientology' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>OnceUponaTime</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52993"> 				October 1, 2010 at 2:21 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52993#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52993", "52993", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to OnceUponaTime'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Margaret,</p> <p>When I left the church back in the early eighties, I was pretty happy when some media source brought up OT3 to disparage the church.  It was just one of those points of ridicule that became indefensible.  It put the church on its heels and could not be easily defended.  Damned if you say &#8220;yes,&#8221; damned if you say, &#8220;no.&#8221;<br /> And then to slant the whole argument to, &#8220;see what foolishness these idiots aspire to as a higher state of consciousness!  Fucking space aliens, for God&#8217;s sake!  Would you really want to study that shit?&#8221;<br /> I was furious with the church of Scientology.  Absolutely incensed that a church would have an external affairs section hell bent on destroying the lives of anyone who spoke against them.  I could have cared less what the members of a church believed as long as the members don&#8217;t believe they have the right to harm or destroy another merely for the crime of exposing a truth or voicing an opinion.<br /> It still infuriates me.<br /> As it should any person interested in understanding, personal integrity, and freedom of speech.<br /> But, to the point, the OT3 data just has that leverage, that bit of positioning which makes the church look nutty to the average viewer.  The whole thing is pretty easy to handle, as you&#8217;ve done above, but the church still hasn&#8217;t figured it out.  And the media and critics won&#8217;t let it go until the church comes up with an answer.<br /> As you&#8217;ve demonstrated, the answer will come from the Independents, when reason is applied.  Almost anyone will understand that the universe is filled with mysteries and what we&#8217;re trying to do is understand life as best we can.  Sometimes, what we find doesn&#8217;t make sense at first.  Like molecules and atoms comprised mostly of space made no sense when explaining something as solid as a brass goblet.  How could such nonsense explain something so firm and solid and strong?<br /> OT3 is merely an interesting possibility, an incidental story, not a sacred belief.  It&#8217;s like finding grandma fucking the milkman when you were six; the experience may have affected you, but you would be you with or without the experience.<br /> And Scientology would be Scientology regardless of what incidents we might or might not find in our search for truth.  The incidents are about as close to being absolutely irrelevant as anything can come to being an &#8220;absolute.&#8221;<br /> It&#8217;s the basics that are relevant.  What comprises life?  And what laws apply to those elements?<br /> Forgive my rambling.  I&#8217;m still working all this out, trying to understand, trying to assign proper importance and rearrange the furniture.<br /> So, I agree with you and thank you for the insights.</p> <p>Michael</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-53027"> 		<div id="comment-53027"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b5ccf5df0b185252b53f035d771bf809?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">John Peeler</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-53027"> 				October 1, 2010 at 6:11 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=53027#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-53027", "53027", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to John Peeler'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Why is it that the whole time I was in Scientology, 23 years, after reading Dianetics several times, and after reading HCOB after HCOB, trained up through Class IV, as well as just making it practically a mission of mine to study the Tech for my own interest, and listen to many LRH lectures, the research behind the discoveries was never fully provided, if at all in most cases. It&#8217;s all based on someone&#8217;s &#8220;conclusions.&#8221; So, just because LRH said &#8220;This is what I came up with in my research&#8230;&#8221; we&#8217;re supposed to accept that hook line and sinker? Not me.</p> <p>From having lived through and grown up in Scientology, and after having gotten out of the CofS, I have become a realist, and someone who asks for PROOF. I know what LRH said about people who ask for proof, but I don&#8217;t care or happen to agree with that point of view. My belief in something also comes with it, how it was made to be that way. And I&#8217;m not talking about having to know what makes a car drive before buying one. Religion is NOT even close to being in the same category, especially when you&#8217;re talking about the minds of people, the answer to spirituality and the answer to life itself.</p> <p>Yes, there are positive things and workable things in Scientology, I agree, but Scientology, just by KSW alone is sold as a whole package. It&#8217;s not a buffet religion. You can&#8217;t just pick and choose what to agree and disagree with. Maybe it started out that way but then KSW came along and brought about a whole other way things must be looked at. The Study Tech even tells you that if you disagree, or don&#8217;t understand something in Scientology, you have an MU. Fucking yawn and you have an MU. Based on what?</p> <p>Believe and have faith in whatever you want. We&#8217;re lucky to have that freedom. But if you expect the rest of the world to accept Scientology as a religion or even as a valuable subject, MOST people will want the scientific proof. No joke.</p> <p>When I was a child in Scientology, it wasn&#8217;t really considered a religion BTW. But a &#8220;religious PHILOSOPHY&#8221; based on Scientific research and studies. That it was different from other religions because you didn&#8217;t have to have &#8220;faith&#8221; in something because there was a logical and scientific explanation for everything. But as it turned out, most of Scientology&#8217;s Tech is based on what LRH concluded from his own research. It would have really been nice had those research and case studies for it been fully provided. It would have also been nice if LRH had actually been a Nuclear Physicist and Medical Doctor as touted on the cover of his &#8220;All About Radiation&#8221; too.</p> <p>Let me put it this way, even in the real world, when something is being provided as scientific proof, it can absolutely be seen as real because it is fully explained and backed up by full research as to how it IS that way. It&#8217;s fail and fool proof. Real, like gravity. We don&#8217;t have to take someone&#8217;s word for it.</p> <p>I stopped taking people&#8217;s word on anything after I left. Do I need to take Obama&#8217;s word that the new health care system is gonna work just because he and his people say so? Hell no.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-martyrathbun09 comment-author-is-site-member bypostauthor even depth-5 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-53031"> 		<div id="comment-53031"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c2d94d163a566268e73c8b0195b6c03a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">martyrathbun09</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-53031"> 				October 1, 2010 at 6:23 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=53031#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-53031", "53031", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to martyrathbun09'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>John, your post is self contradictory.

Anyone.  Doctors, psychologists,  physicists, University researchers, scientists, etc etc.</p> <p>He commented that as far as he knew no-one had taken that up.</p> <p>But  I suspect some did that,  and we just didn&#8217;t hear about it.<br /> The research we have heard about was done by government agencies who were interested in &#8220;defense&#8217; applications.  They would be just as likely to publicly say  &#8220;Naw, there&#8217;s nothing to it.&#8221;</p> <p>It would be  the same for psychiatrists, for example.  There is no other group than medical doctors,  as likely to incorporate a useful technique like dianetics into their own practices, and then attempt to stamp out anyone else using it.   I t&#8217;s al labout market share, in  their case.   This is perfectly well documented,  as in the AMA&#8217;s decades long attempt to suppress Chiropractors, which finally stopped when they were sued in Federal court and lost.  </p> <p>So  Doctors would also likely say &#8220;Naw,  move along. There&#8217;s nothing here to see&#8221;,  even as they incorporated some of the ideas and methods into their own practices.   Because maximum profits are tied to monopolize a market and be the &#8220;go to&#8221; practitioners.</p> <p>The fact is,  it would not be easy to find a truly disinterested and objective group of academics or researchers to run studies and do tests.</p> <p>As with many other things,  with auditing and training, &#8220;the proof of the pudding is in the eating.&#8221;</p> <p>If it doesn&#8217;t taste good to you,  pass on it and order something else.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-5 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-53114"> 		<div id="comment-53114"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/35c099a407c6bcb69554239271f5ded7?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Margaret</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-53114"> 				October 2, 2010 at 4:15 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=53114#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-53114", "53114", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Margaret'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>John Peeler wrote: &#8220;Why is it that the whole time I was in Scientology, 23 years, &#8230; the research behind the discoveries was never fully provided&#8230;?&#8221;</p> <p>Because it&#8217;s an <i>applied <b>philosophy</b></i> not an <i>applied <b>science</b></i>.</p> <p>With regard to KSW, please re-read RJ68 &#8212; good excerpt here:<br /> <a href="http://www.scnforum.org/index.php?t=msg&#038;goto=77#msg_77" rel="nofollow">http://www.scnforum.org/index.php?t=msg&#038;goto=77#msg_77</a></p> <p>If you&#8217;re looking for scientific evidence to support underlying ideas in Scientology, I&#8217;d recommend Ian Stevenson, as well as the SRI research by Hal Puthoff , Russ Targ, Swann, et al.

(Thus, the idea of differentiation is strongly implied.) It is formed from the Greek word logos, which means THE WORD, or OUTWARD FORM BY WHICH THE INWARD THOUGHT IS EXPRESSED AND MADE KNOWN: also THE INWARD THOUGHT or REASON ITSELF. Thus, SCIENTOLOGY means KNOWING ABOUT KNOWING, or SCIENCE OF KNOWLEDGE. (Scn 8-80, p. 8) 2 .   S c i e n t o l o g y  addresses the thetan.

The challage for the producer is to keep the viewer in their seat and away from the remote control.</p> <p>IMHO the BBC scored well and I suspect their audience stayed with this show.  If you were a non-scientologist I did not see any reason why a viewer would reach for this cult like religion.  Not one.</p> <p>For me the whole hour was summed up with that very long and very tragic tear coming down Mareka&#8217;s cheek.  There is no joy in this cult.

He had a score to settle with the Church after the &#8216;exploding tomato&#8217; incident, and what better way to get revenge than by using a defector to corroborate everything the BBC had to say the first time around, especially the spying and stalking.</p> <p>But did it tell me anything about Scientology? Not really. And although there would have been material new to some people in there, by and large it was a re-run of every critical programme since Scientology began. To me, the stand-out programme of the past few decades was Channel 4&#8217;s &#8216;Beginners Guide to L Ron Hubbard&#8217;. I say standout in the sense that it was one of the few programmes that would actually make someone more interested in scientology (note the lower case S) while being gently aware of the toxic nature of The Church. </p> <p>John  Sweeney&#8217;s film gave viewers little room to see why Scientology has been so attractive to hundreds of thousands over the decades; what we saw was a collection of shouty unattractive apologists, combined with unfairly presented Space Opera material, and a litany of (totally honest) criticisms from people cruelly treated by their church. Perhaps the only point where there was even a glimpse of the positive side to  scientology came when Marty had John on the meter &#8211; my wife (who has no interest in this matter whatsoever) was genuinely impressed at how the meter was reading something. But beyond that, it did half the job. It will keep people away from the Church. But it is unlikely to lead anyone to examine the subject of scientology further.</p> <p>I do not consider myself an ex-scientologist. I did the comm course and a few hours of auditing. I later had a run-in with the Church because I disagreed with the tech, and discovered just how disagreeable the Church can be. But  I think there is a massive amount of good in the tech that needs liberating. I see the Independent Scientologists working long and hard to uncover this good material, and I wish them the best. Programmes like this are helpful insofar as they draw people&#8217;s attention to the fact that there is an Independent movement out there.</p> <p>But I think the direction forward needs to be away from reacting to what the Church gets up  to in towards reclaiming the tech. That means more &#8216;Beginners&#8217; Guides&#8217; and less &#8216;Panorama&#8217;. It&#8217;s difficult because the Church is such an oxygen-sucking horror show, and when you can get the media interested, it&#8217;s more interested in the negative than the positive. But we do want people to see the positive. Blogs such as Marty&#8217;s do a tremdous job in this refocussing work. But on reflection, however pleased I am that Sweeney caused a little more grief for the unspeakable Tommy Davis, I don&#8217;t think that programmes such as this take the debate much further. I want to see a programme that looks at how the meter works. I want to see a programme that takes someone through auditing and out of misery into happiness. I&#8217;d like to see a programme that focuses on how the technology works. I&#8217;d like to see Independents civilly discuss with other mental health practitioners the advantages of scientology. In other words, I want to see scientology come out of its self-imposed ghetto and relate to the outside world once more.</p> <p>Right now the Church is talking to itself. I think that Indies offer scientology its only chance to actually engage with the world. For that, the spiral has to be broken &#8211; Indies need to be able to present their work on its own terms, not as a &#8216;cleaned up&#8217; response to the excesses of te Miscavage empire.</p> <p>I realise how difficult this is, and I realise that the Church will do anything to stop this.

Which is over IMO.<br /> I like your ideal scene. I still hold it for not makeable, except in small groups which more or less don&#8217;t care of public opinions, mass media, morphic field influences, controlled social  operation and so on &#8211; but without this all, it&#8217;s not in BBC &#8230; at best, the time might be ripe to do some of it on the net, but also there not aiming at the big broad effect. It&#8217;s done anyway, everywhere where a piece of good tech (of whatever provenience) is given with high ARC from one to another, or where stuck ideas are listened to and thusly released or eradicated &#8211; how ever this cycle is named and its magic explained.<br /> However it was good to meet your ideas.

The problem with protest blogs and journalistic / scholarly criticism is that important elements such as purpose, intention and reality factor are often left on the editing floor.   The same is true for rabid criticism and rabid fanaticism.  </p> <p>All too often I see snips of LRH materials quoted to carry an argument &#8212; the are taken out of context both in terms of surrounding or later materials and in terms of the time period in which they were written.  There is little regard for the possibility that one&#8217;s viewpoint can and does change over time through experience and new knowledge, through fundamental changes in tone level &#8211; to name a few things.  I have always been surprised to find that I can read the same materials from a new viewpoint / insight that I gained from auditing or just living life and find that my understanding of it has changed.  Often quite markedly.  </p> <p>IMO the most important message is that this information cannot be ENFORCED on people.  You can&#8217;t MAKE someone better.  You can MAKE them behave in a different way by using FORCE but you cannot produce reason by using FORCE.  One of my greatest challenges over the years has been dealing with staff members who want to HELP me by enforcing their viewpoint and interpretations on me by saying something along the lines of &#8220;LRH says&#8230;&#8221;  Indeed, LRH said a lot of things.  Millions of words in fact, so many that you can&#8217;t possibly jump in with LRH says in a pet quote.  Losing sight of the changes over time, the events occurring at the time, the problems being addressed, the overarching principles and underlying fundamentals has led to this ridiculous point of view of LRH as a demi-god and the research / discussion / training materials and lectures found in the books and tapes  as &#8220;scriptures&#8221; to be followed &#8220;or else.&#8221;  &#8220;Or else&#8221; is just enforcement, is a violation of core principles and I believe it is the primary reason for the disastrous state of the C of S.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52822"> 		<div id="comment-52822"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/35c099a407c6bcb69554239271f5ded7?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Margaret</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52822"> 				September 30, 2010 at 8:57 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52822#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52822", "52822", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Margaret'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Another excellent post Maria.

Thought the feature was compelling.  </p> <p>Maybe the disappointment lies more in expectations:  like being told a movie is the best things ever, sitting through it and thinking, &#8220;Hmm, not that great.&#8221;  Or being told a movie is the worst thing ever, sitting through it and thinking, &#8220;Hmm, not that bad, had some good parts.&#8221;</p> <p>The intrusiveness of the church was manifest in the ubiquitous cameras.  The lies and betrayals came through loud and clear.  All the attempts to intimidate, the spiked fences, Tommy&#8217;s nastiness.  As Sweeny asked, &#8220;Is this how this church goes about its business?&#8221;</p> <p>Look at the &#8220;missed opportunity&#8221; in a different way:  a thetan loves a mystery.  A good writer does not provide too much information too early in the story.  The author wants the reader to continue to turn the page, to be compelled to find out.  Maybe this will get some to research further who had not thought to do so before.</p> <p>That the material was often a rehash of what we&#8217;ve seen before is less important than it serving as a continued message.  Certainly we here on this blog have seen it all before.  But others have not.  And even if they have, a study datum says that number of times over material equals certainty and results.  The audience is learning.  This program may be the moment of revelation, when the data actually gets through, past the denial and the apathy.  This organization needs to be handled.  </p> <p>Michael</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-martyrathbun09 comment-author-is-site-member bypostauthor even depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52545"> 		<div id="comment-52545"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c2d94d163a566268e73c8b0195b6c03a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">martyrathbun09</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52545"> 				September 29, 2010 at 4:01 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52545#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52545", "52545", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to martyrathbun09'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I probably should have added the fact that I am much too close up and involved to be very objective.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52548"> 		<div id="comment-52548"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a1049d2528a46f6bd92dca4577fd768f?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://www.unicef.org/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Cat Daddy</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52548"> 				September 29, 2010 at 4:05 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52548#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52548", "52548", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Cat Daddy'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>What Micheal said.

That to me aligns with this  spirit as well.  Its the type of person whose desire for Light reaches beyond  themselves.<br />   The Sea Org and Scientology attracted a lot of them.

It was quite apparent that there is indeed something that is &#8220;restimulation&#8221;.  It is REAL, not a fantasy of LRH&#8217;s or Scientologists.  The purpose of this board&#8230;.the obvious real purpose&#8230;.is clearly destimulation.  Of course, that means RUNNING OUT the engram which is obviously underway.  Sometimes I see posts from people who are part of the engram or stuck in it. The original purpose of the Sea Org was to run out the Fourth Dynamic engram of this planet &#8211; the Third Dynamic engram obviously as well.  It was obvious to some of us some thirty years ago that the 3D engram was bigger than the 4th.  Bad stuff obviously needs to be brought up to be cleared out, but it is great to see and encourage postings, comments and actions which actually DESTIMULATE.  Also, keep in mind that all the understandable emotions of hate that accrue to DM, TC, etc. only feed their demons which live off that stuff.  If you want to talk about UNFLAT OT Levels, look at them!!!!   Freedom from overwhelm?   It is impossible to be free from overwhelm if you are overwhelming others.  They do, however, portray an excellent DRAMATIZATION of CAUSE OVER LIFE.  My suggestion is that everyone who reads this send flow of love towards DM, TC, etc. and their demons.  Wouldn&#8217;t it be something if someone had the wherewithal to convince them they could accept an amnesty with no repurcussions provided they come clean, etc?</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52599"> 		<div id="comment-52599"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/84d84902fc8c43c0aede07ea1b549fcb?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Li Po</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52599"> 				September 29, 2010 at 6:20 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52599#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52599", "52599", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Li Po'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Good point</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52571"> 		<div id="comment-52571"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/33aa83a43734faa3553929c88bb36ccf?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Joe Howard</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52571"> 				September 29, 2010 at 4:44 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52571#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52571", "52571", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Joe Howard'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>There is one aspect of this documentary that is indisputable, the one string that any parishioner involved with the church needs to pull. Any of the arguments put forward by John Sweeney or counter-arguments by the church can be rationalized away depending on which side you are on. But what cannot be washed away is how much better Mike looks today than he did three years ago. How the hell is that possible? People, once they reach a certain age are supposed to begin falling apart.  How could Mike, years later, seem to be falling together? Makes no sense. THAT is something for the on-lines Scientologists reading this blog to grapple with.

Lots of people will tune in to see an expose on Scientology.  On Miscavige, not so much.  You and I might be on the edge of our seats to hear of his atrocities (most of which we already know about) but the fact is, the rest of the world doesn&#8217;t give a rat&#8217;s fart about this guy.</p> <p>That could change though, and soon.  Personally I would like &#8220;miscavige&#8221; to become a household word.  Maybe even a verb.</p> <p>I think the broadcast was everything we had a right to expect, and well done to Mike, Marty, Amy, Mark and Claire Headley and Mariska for pushing it to that stage.

I realized that throughout my years in and around Scientology, the Church has always been PARANOID of reporters and the press. Plain PARANOID. Treats them like enemies.</p> <p>In 1991 I was working back &amp; forth at 2 locations &#8211; HGB and PAC Base. Both locations had News trucks with antennas on the roof driving around and around. Channel 2 Action News, etc. Sometimes they had helicopters hovering around. Security was all over the place to fend them off. </p> <p>It would have been sooo much easier for the &#8220;officials&#8221; to INVITE THEM IN and SHOW THEM that Scientology is OK.  Do a pinch test LIVE on camera. Ask a couple of questions from Self-Analysis and get them to SEE the needle reactions. A bit of 2-way-comm to Floating Needle. Word Clearing, Study Tech, etc. etc. etc. </p> <p>In other words &#8211; DEMYSTIFY the subject instead of perpetuating the controversy.</p> <p>Marty,  Mike, Amy, et all,  you did a GREAT job in that episode. A while ago, you started with the St. Pete Times videos (small scale, 3rd Dynamic) then CNN Anderson Cooper 360 and now the BBC Panorama which reaches WORLDWIDE on the 4th dynamic all over the GLOBE !

None of the DM beatings and other psychopathic behavior- too bad there- but a dramatic piece none the less.</p> <p>OSA obviously impressed upon the BBC not to mention DM.</p> <p>None the less, the piece left me with a sense that the CoS is a cult,  that lies,  spies,  intimidates,  enforces abortions and destroys families inside and outside the church.  This is a very bad P/R piece for the church.</p> <p>Unfortunately it requires the listener to evaluate the data to connect the dots to DM as the head.  I beleive this is unlikely in the general public. </p> <p>In Marketing and P/R one is putting forward an idea an impression.  The data are generally lost.  The impression here is decidedly negative, offensively so.  That is what will be remembered next week,  not the data.  The next time DM is in the news, the impression from this piece will snap terminals to DM.  It is a forgone conclusion.  It is the nature of the bank.</p> <p>Any thinking Scientologists-non kool aide drinkers- knows much of this data is true from their own experiences. </p> <p>Defections always start from personally questioning the goings on and eventually getting ones fill.  And for me personally the final item was knowing there was an alternative.</p> <p>I beleive this piece aligns very well with the above.

Granted it probably could have been more damning of the little fu*%er but I think with the material available you could do a 10<br /> part series and not cover it all.</p> <p>More important from my perspective is credibility. How Marty, Mike and the others came off in this program is how much more credible and SANE they were. Add in the visuals of an obviously beautiful, happy family unit such as the Headleys, the heart breaking story of Mareka&#8217;s lost love ( damn where are those tissues), Jason&#8217;s everyman straight up forthrightness and Amy&#8217;s branded Scarlett letter A ( man this church is obsessed with sex or what), one can only look at them and wonder what is wrong with this. When you through  in the obvious transformation of Mike one can&#8217;t help and wonder what is wrong here. Compare this to the visual of the CoS, lots of fancy schmanzxy real Estate, overproduce production videos making it look like they are selling a religion rather than being one, plus the screaming attack on Mike and the PIs on Sweeney&#8217;s tail the whole issue of credibility is glaringly obvious. This is no religion but a CULT! </p> <p>I am not a scientologist but from where I sit as an observer and public the Indies came off very well but I don&#8217;t think the BBC was going to do a promotional piece for the Indies. There was no way the BBC and Sweeney were not going to take advantage of this opportunity to vindicate themselves after the tearing they receive in 2007. I doubt this time the CoS little response video will be as effective. I watched it and I found it just made it worse. The camera shots from various securitycameras made it even more scary. How much security does a Church need anyway? I doubt banks have this much security.They have every perceivable angle covered. This is not security it&#8217;s Big Brother watching outside and inside the buildings. </p> <p>When a dam breaks it doesn&#8217;t fail all at once. First it takes is a small crack or fault. Then pressure builds up in those areas and eventually more cracks developed, and then more until it eventually lets go. Lil&#8217; Davie is the kid with his finger plugging a few holes here and there. Eventually he will run out of fingers and the cracks becomes to numreous to plug and the dam gives way to a veritable flood. Once that dam goes those down stream better get moving because there will be no controlling it.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52686"> 		<div id="comment-52686"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/35c099a407c6bcb69554239271f5ded7?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Margaret</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52686"> 				September 30, 2010 at 3:06 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52686#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52686", "52686", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Margaret'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Mitsu Too, you wrote: &#8220;Compare this to the visual of the CoS, lots of fancy schmanzxy real Estate, overproduce production videos <b>making it look like they are selling a religion rather than being one</b>&#8221;</p> <p>LOL.

Hiring PI&#8217;s and telling big lies to society?  What would happen if Scientology ever did become mainstream?  What if there was a President that was a Scientologist and lots of Senators too.  Then one day the President had a disagreement and wanted to resign from the church?  Would all the senators have to cut comm with the President?  The disconnection  policy is insane!!!

To those that were indoctrinated during the &#8220;Orientation Film&#8221; era, seeing you will have a huge impact.  Thank you for your stellar contribution.</p> <p>The show was &#8220;theta&#8221;.  The editing, photography, and scene setting, first class.  Compare and contrast to the products out of Golden Era.  And I think it was intentional,y  so,  and therfore inviting to those that have never been involved.</p> <p>Application of Tech:  Marty&#8217;s E-Meter demo was great, and validating Mr. Sweeny&#8217;s awareness of his &#8220;naughty thought&#8221; showed that he &#8220;got&#8221; it.   I also found it poignant that he ran a bit of a &#8220;locational&#8221; on Mike, interviewing him at the spot were he made his decision to no longer be other-determined and take back his self-determinism.  That is a very strong subtext to this whole thing.</p> <p>Compare that to the scenes of the Miscavologists.   EVERY single one of them, &#8220;celebrities&#8221; included, were prime examples of THOUGHT STOPPING TECH in action.   And we know what the point where a being tries to stop things demarcates.

Am I correct? If so, is Marty&#8217;s behavior really the target of your feeling? Or if it&#8217;s something else, what is it?</p> <p>I&#8217;ve discovered <i>anger</i> is a tragic expression of an unmet need. That once one discovers what their real need is, their anger dissipates, and they are enabled to rationally strategize on how to meet that need so the anger about whatever item one was angry about, doesn&#8217;t make themselves or others miserable about it anymore. </p> <p>What makes me sad is the unnecessary &#8220;enemy&#8221; type thinking which could be totally avoided to make for a more peaceful and happier existance for all. Surely, most want that. Don&#8217;t you?</p> <p>I&#8217;m trying to understand what it is that you&#8217;re really looking for by posting what you have above? Would you be willing to expound?</p> <p>Perhaps you may find the subject of nonviolent communication as interesting and as helpful as I have. It&#8217;s tech designed to help each individual more joyfully get their own and others&#8217; needs met more peacefully in a way (through compassionate giving) which contributes to life, rather than of degrading it by upsetting other people (intentionally or unintentionally) &#8230;</p> <p>&#8220;Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life&#8221;, by Marshall B.

I don&#8217;t know why Sweeney or the BBC chose to cut out the secrets that Marty gave them, but given UK libel &amp; defamation laws, the Church&#8217;s massive litigation and their very litigious history, the BBC, whose programs are financed by the taxpayer, reacted with the usual &#8220;deer in the headlights&#8221; response to being sued by Scientology attorneys.  If the BBC was a private institution with loads of money to defend itself in lawsuits, the outcome may have been different.

There was more to say? Fine. Don&#8217;t despair. Remember, it&#8217;s all about persistence and gradients.  What was revealed was remarkable on several levels. </p> <p> I think what stands out to me the most is  the high tone level (including Sweeney) of your team vs the CofS folks.  Tommy Davis is simply an embarrasment. He barely gets out of 1.5 and his highest momentary tone is 2.0! The celebes are so antago! There answers are actually and purposely non-sequitor.  The beauty of that scene is that Sweeney calmly asks simple questions, which are valid, and he gets entheta back. That is what the uninformed audience will see. Add that to the other scenes with Amy and the Headleys and what comes accross is that the people in the &#8220;Church&#8221; are crude and defensive. The folks no longer with the &#8220;Church&#8221; are the antithesis of that.  So, it isn&#8217;t all about how much &#8220;data&#8221; has been given, but what the video is showing. The visual impressions are the most telling and will impinge. </p> <p>   A point on the &#8220;data&#8221; is that for every lie told the truth was revealed. That was well done.  I would like to say that the &#8220;church&#8221; denile of the OT3 info is absurd.<br />     Actually, Ron talks about many whole track incidents freely, and the OT3 story is not going to make anyone sick, anymore or less, than other space opera. The process of it has not ( thankfully) been distributed, and it is KNOWING THE PROCESS  which might cause a disturbance.  It is not the general story. The questions that Sweeney was asking could have been answered truthfully. I mean all religions have creation myths, and they are ALL wild. So we should not be so afraid of discussing it to some degree. Too much mystery keeps the public fixed on it and there can be no as-isness.  Then, they top it off with constant lies to really make the subject solid. They are such idiots and they think they are so slick. They CAN&#8217;T get three feet behind the &#8220;Church&#8221; because they can&#8217;t get three feet behind themselves.</p> <p>Thanks Marty, Mike et al. for all you are doing.

Media and general public are attracted by controversy and a shouting bigoted BBC journalist is a very good example; he was the laughing stock of the journalistic world for three years, thanks Tommy! He attracted more attention for the past three years than any campaign in history and thus he now yields top exposure with the highest mainstream tv ratings. The scumbag tactics of the present Church were nicely exposed and the greatest dirt Davey could dig up was an aggressive drunken Marty and a demoted Mike, both caused by the Church and both beautifully recovered after leaving. The gradient applied, the tone level hit, the sense of reality with respect to the general public and the impact created was superb and not easily duplicated by any Scientologist, in or out.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52810"> 		<div id="comment-52810"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7f059d870d3292ad4dbe02bb47b88f6a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Kirsi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52810"> 				September 30, 2010 at 7:38 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52810#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52810", "52810", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Kirsi'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>So sorry Erwin, but I do not follow what ya say.

the session can be secretly viewed to make sure the needle swung three times.<br /> At least one good-looking superstar celebrity to instill confidence.<br /> One mad man dictator to keep in all in

I thought the broadcast was the exact right gradient for the public. It showed the goodness of the Tech, (the e-meter demo was amazing). The information Mike gave about Tommy baiting  Sweeney was good because it showed how evil Tommy  and DM are.  Also, Mikes&#8217; honesty in  letting Sweeney know exactly what was going on at the time showed that there is Tech to be learned about the Mind.   It set you both up as Opinion Leaders.  The broadcast communicated to me your love of Scn and your courage and sacrifices in battling its&#8217; destruction.  &#8220;The Secrets &#8221; not being published creates a Mystery and maybe a book with the same title would be the way to go.<br /> Love you,  C.

It wasn&#8217;t the wisdom.  It wasn&#8217;t the comm course.  It wasn&#8217;t the idea of going clear.  It wasn&#8217;t the idea of saving the planet.  It was the good-looking women.  </p> <p>Nothing like a beautiful woman to set my heart thumping.  </p> <p>No wonder advertiser use those images.  Within a week of starting the comm course I had paid for training through level four and auditing through OT3&#8211;just because the reg was so damned cute.  </p> <p>So, maybe next lifetime, when my head is clear, my heart pure and my motives noble, I will return to lend service to humanity.  But, for now&#8230;  Ah!  My heart is set to thumping.</p> <p>And regardless of my initial motivation, I&#8217;ve learned a few things along the way.  And met lots of friends.  People I truly enjoy.  And one of the wonders of the independent movement is that we can go back to just enjoying one another simply because it feels so right.  We can share our thoughts and give our support without fear of repercussion.  </p> <p>That which motivates us varies from individual to individual.  But each has so much to contribute, both here and with one another.   Great religions spread by word of mouth, not by corporate finesse.  It will be our words, our mouths, by which Scientology will spread.  </p> <p>We are the emissaries of a philosophy.  We are the lovers of wisdom.</p> <p>Ain&#8217;t it a bitch?</p> <p>Michael</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52802"> 		<div id="comment-52802"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a1049d2528a46f6bd92dca4577fd768f?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://www.unicef.org/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Cat Daddy</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52802"> 				September 30, 2010 at 6:25 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52802#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52802", "52802", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Cat Daddy'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>You got flirty-fished without them even trying.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52877"> 		<div id="comment-52877"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2fb4b1135fe28557060ab78b6f1f42b7?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://leavingscientology.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>OnceUponaTime</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52877"> 				October 1, 2010 at 12:55 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52877#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52877", "52877", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to OnceUponaTime'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Cat Daddy,</p> <p>&#8220;Flirty fished?&#8221;   Interesting way to put it.<br /> This was 1970.  The Scientology stuff cost me about the same as a brand new German sports car I had just purchased for cash.  The sports car has long since lost its value.  The Scientology has continued to provide value far beyond its cost.<br /> The cute reg was sincerely interested in me and my well being.  It wasn&#8217;t a scam or a sales push.  We were just talking.  She was pregnant.  I wasn&#8217;t really interested in her or what I could get out of her.  Her message just made sense.  And proved prophetic.<br /> So, flirting sometimes can lead to something greater.  My wife and I flirted the first time we met and ended up with two kids.  And we still love each other.<br /> And fishing can be a hell of a lot of fun.<br /> Michael</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52924"> 		<div id="comment-52924"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a1049d2528a46f6bd92dca4577fd768f?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://www.unicef.org/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Cat Daddy</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52924"> 				October 1, 2010 at 5:46 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52924#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52924", "52924", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Cat Daddy'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>You always bring calm and personal touch to the scene.

I thought it was very powerful, very damaging to CofM. Especially the 4th segment. Seeing all those hired investigators following Sweeney around was chilling. Hearing the profane screams directed at Mike by his family in the parking lot was frightening (and saddening). </p> <p>I also thought the fact that Sweeney included the boilerplate CofM denial every time he presented credible evidence of a CofM atrocity or outrage had to have been very damaging to CofM. Every fact was presented either by direct video or stated by a very credible witness (and all came across as such, to their great credit). </p> <p>To have obvious facts denied over &amp; over communicated clearly that CofM is a scary organization, one that is running amok in society, unaccountable, attempting to intimidate anyone who disagrees with them. </p> <p>I&#8217;m no newbie &amp; by now I&#8217;m well aware of what has been and is going on &#8211; and yet, I experienced chills as I watched this program. I can only imagine what impression the average viewer came away with. It cannot have been anything but devastating for DM and his dwindling band of not so merry men (and women).</p> <p>As others have remarked, the tear coming down Mareka&#8217;s cheek at the end created the most profound impact of all. Seeing that made me choke up. What a terrible thing to do to another human being. And to LRH&#8217;s legacy.

I couldn&#8217;t find any way of sending you a scanned copy (fair enough; am guessing you&#8217;d be constantly spammed if you put your email address on here), so have typed it out for you.  Here it is:<br /> &#8220;&#8216; YOU suck cock on Hollywood Boulevard.&#8221; This is the word of the Church of Scientology, according to its former spokesman Mike Rinder, who spilled the beans in John Sweeney&#8217;s BBC film this week.<br /> He was citing a text message sent from the office of the leader, David Miscavige, Tom Cruise&#8217;s best man  one of many bizarre obscenities, Rinder claims. After half a century inside the church, Rinder now says that it is a cult.</p> <p>But some public figures in Britain are still happy to give it the benefit of the doubt. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think Scientologists get a fair deal,&#8221; Jonathan Ross wrote in his autobiography. When Tom Cruise repaid the favour by appearing on Ross&#8217;s show, the sycophantic host gave him a very fair deal indeed by not asking about Scientology at all.</p> <p>Another admirer is the coalition&#8217;s new minister for climate change, Charles Hendry, a Tory MP whose seat borders the 59-acre Scientology estate in East Grinstead. In 2004 Hendry attended the premiere of Tom Cruise&#8217;s film Collateral. &#8220;I thought Tom was absolutely amazing,&#8221; he gushed. When the star chatted to Hendry&#8217;s stepdaughter on the MP&#8217;s mobile phone, Hendry said: &#8220;Clare thought it was the coolest thing ever.&#8221; A year later, in July 2005, Hendry told the House of Commons: &#8220;Although Scientology may be very controversial&#8230; undoubtedly as human beings they do a great deal of good&#8230; certainly as an organisation it&#8217;s gone through serious hoops in terms of making sure it has the right to broadcast on TV, satisfying the broadcasting commission that it isn&#8217;t a cult.&#8221;</p> <p>The &#8220;broadcasting commission&#8221; is a reference to the Independent Television Commission, which has since been succeeded by Ofcom.  Neither body was in a position to say whether the church was or was not a cult, and neither did. But Judge Latey in the high court in 1984 called it exactly that: &#8220;a cult&#8230; corrupt, sinister and dangerous&#8230; out to capture people and&#8230; brainwash them.&#8221;</p> <p>In Britain, the church operates as the Church of Scientology Religious Educational College Inc. a not-for-profit organisation which filed an income of L12,958,196 in 2008. Despite its wealth, and the Charity Commission&#8217;s ruling that the church isn&#8217;t a charity for religious purposes, the City of London Corporation grants 80 percent rates relief for its &#8220;London Org&#8221; (ie HQ) on Queen Victoria Street, thus saving it a total of L1,306,363 in rates since the centre opened in 2006. Westminster city council gives 80 percent rate relief on its &#8220;London Celebrity Centre&#8221; in Leinster Gardens, saving it L165,303 over the past decade. Birmingham city council gives 80 percent rates relief on the Scientology property at Winston Churchill House, as does Sunderland council at the new L5m &#8220;Org&#8221; on Fawcett Street. Whether the church enjoys rates relief on the most famous Scientology property in Britain, its &#8220;stress test centre&#8221; on Tottenham Court Road, is a secret: Camden council refuses to answer questions on the subject.</p> <p>A few brave local authorities haven&#8217;t yet been brainwashed. Manchester city council charges the full commercial rate on the L5m &#8220;Org&#8221; in Deansgate. as does Mid-Sussex district council for the estate at Saint Hill Manor near East Grinstead. With a government minister on the Scientologists&#8217; side, however, can it be long before the dissenting councils cave in to Tom Cruise&#8217;s creepy church?</p> <p> PS: Further proof of the Scientologists&#8217; wealth is the fact that their solicitors sent the BBC hundreds of letters, running to 1,100 pages in all, while Sweeney was preparing his latest film. Since the solicitors in question are Carter- Fuck &#8211; take a bow, partner Alasdair Pepper &#8211; the bill is unlikely to be much less than Llm.&#8221;<br /> (N.B. &#8216;Carter-Fuck&#8217; is how Private Eye always refers to the London law firm Carter-Ruck).

All involved did a great job. You need to<br /> take a win on this. All of you. My concern is that it also painted a negative<br /> view of Scientology and LRH to the public. If I were a public anything<br /> having to do with Scientology I would avoid. I am glad they included<br /> the stuff you did with the e-meter. You did a great job. But saying LRH was a science fiction writer and the OT3 Xenu stuff just made the subject of Scientology look wierd to the public.  To a public the good guys<br /> left Scientology because it was bad. I&#8217;m afraid the public are going to see<br /> &#8216;Scientology&#8217; as a cult and not just the &#8216;Church&#8217;.

Marty explained the process logically, unsensationally, in a good-natured way and demonstrated how it worked.

And it was poignant and beautiful to watch.    Marty Rathbun is an ace and true auditor, with all the unshakable compassion that comes with understanding and knowing the woof and warp of human condition foibles.    Mike Rinder&#8217;s presence was a living attestation to his obvious purpose and character, an emissary of the balm of understanding.   It also spoke volumes for the inherent goodness and sensibility of the BBC journalist John Sweeney.  It was simply magnificent!

Id just like to try to paint a picture for you of how different the Church of Scientology used to be compared to today and why it is that Martys auditor behavior appeared to be so safe when you saw him on TV showing John Sweeney how the e-meter worked.  </p> <p>I was a public member of the Church from 1972 through 1988 and spent many, many hours on both sides of the meter  Im OT4 and Class 4.  From those years I dont recall a single time an auditor or a word clearer or a qual person or an ethics officer tried intentionally to make me wrong or harass me or invalidate me or f**k with me in any way.  </p> <p>To illustrate, heres a story that may out me to some lurkers.  Before I was in Scientology I practiced Transcendental Meditation.  In TM youre given a mantra and agree to never reveal your mantra.  (Since then many times Ive seen my TM mantra printed in mainstream magazines and newspapers, so its not really a secret anymore.)  But once in an auditing session the subject of my TM participation and my confidential mantra came up.  My auditor, seeking details, asked what my mantra was.  I said, Sorry!  Thats confidential.  I agreed to keep my mantra a secret.  Not telling!  And my auditor said, Thank you very much, your needles floating.  Ok, now well take up the subject of . And that was the end of that.  </p> <p>Because you see  THATs the way auditing is supposed to go.  Ones own upsets, problems, withholds and the much more interesting things one addresses in auditing are defined and evaluated by the preclear, NOT by the auditor.   The auditors job is to get the preclear into session, ask questions, listen to answers, acknowledge and basically get the hell out of the way.  And, of course, sort things out if things get tangled up or too complicated.  But when the auditor starts interrupting and drawing attention to themselves or being interested in something the preclear has no interest in or telling the preclear that theyre wrong about their perceptions, then the session has gone kaput!  Thats not auditing.  I dont know what that is, but again its not auditing.  </p> <p>This past year Ive been astonished to understand the bizarre changes that have taken place in the Co$ since I left it for reasons having to do with the Scientology organization, especially its money-for-status aspects.  All these stories of heavy-handed sec-checking and black Dianetics and reverse Scientology are still slightly unreal to me  only because I was never subjected to them.  But I absolutely believe the people who are telling these horror stories.</p> <p>So if you hear some of us whinging on and on about the tech  its because we learned about Scientology when it was simply about helping people become more able and explore the bigger Mysteries of Life and our own smaller lives.  I think you would have had to have loved the subject and experienced its effectiveness to now be so appalled by how it has been diluted and destroyed inside the Church to serve the need for greed and power and insanity of a few.  </p> <p>And before anyone else says it  I know, tl; dr.  </p> <p>Just Me</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-martyrathbun09 comment-author-is-site-member bypostauthor odd alt depth-6 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52890"> 		<div id="comment-52890"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c2d94d163a566268e73c8b0195b6c03a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">martyrathbun09</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52890"> 				October 1, 2010 at 1:55 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52890#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52890", "52890", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to martyrathbun09'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Beautiful.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-ahgrasshopper even depth-6 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52911"> 		<div id="comment-52911"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3b7ce26a18fece865bf84652fbc083cc?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://ahgrasshopper.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Grasshopper</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52911"> 				October 1, 2010 at 4:47 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52911#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52911", "52911", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Grasshopper'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>That sums it up, JM &#8211;

I especially liked your last sentence &#8211; anyone reading that would have to come away with a much better understanding of why those of us who are so loyal to the tech are so appalled by what has happened.</p> <p>My track overlaps yours and I agree with everything you say about the scene as it was during much of that time. I would only add that I spent a lot of time at Flag from 1989 to 1996, and during those years, it was also all about helping people become more able. I looked forward to every trip I took to Flag. The staff I dealt with, were some of the friendliest, most helpful, most competent people I&#8217;ve ever known (the exceptions being the ever-present reges, but I never really had much difficulty figuring out ways to avoid them). </p> <p>The services I received, whether training or auditing, were superb. I ALWAYS left Flag feeling like I&#8217;d had a &#8220;spiritual shower&#8221;, ready to tackle life from a much better place. It was a wonderful time. The slogan &#8220;The Friendliest Place in the Whole World&#8221; really meant something then &#8211; it was not just a slogan, it was the truth.</p> <p>Then in 1996, it all changed. It was like a bunch of aliens came in &amp; took over. Kind of like those aliens in &#8220;V&#8221; if you&#8217;ve seen that show &#8211; human on the outside, reptiles on the inside. That was the end for me.</p> <p>As happy as it makes me to contemplate the growth of an independent Scientology movement, it also saddens me to think that the present church is probably beyond reform. That means no more Flag as I knew it. And what becomes of St. Hill Manor? These are to some degree MEST concerns, but there was at one time a lot of theta connected with these and other places in Scientology&#8217;s history.  </p> <p>David Miscavige has so much to answer for.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even depth-5 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52873"> 		<div id="comment-52873"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2fb4b1135fe28557060ab78b6f1f42b7?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://leavingscientology.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>OnceUponaTime</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52873"> 				October 1, 2010 at 12:30 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52873#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52873", "52873", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to OnceUponaTime'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Impartial,</p> <p>Your two cents are worth two cents, but properly invested, who the fuck knows how much they&#8217;re worth.

Thus it behooves the questions &#8230;</p> <p>Are the CofS&#8217;s foot-bullets caused from just plain &#8220;stupidity&#8221; of Staff? </p> <p>Or is there INTENT to damage Scientology by clear design?</p> <p>IMO, it&#8217;s a combination of both.</p> <p>For the well-meaning Staff of CofS, it&#8217;s stupidity caused from their being unknowingly and seriously PTS.</p> <p>Behind their PTS is the cause to destroy Scientology, by design, from a certain, clearly-named (on this blog) SP.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-ahgrasshopper even depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52909"> 		<div id="comment-52909"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3b7ce26a18fece865bf84652fbc083cc?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://ahgrasshopper.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Grasshopper</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52909"> 				October 1, 2010 at 4:32 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52909#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52909", "52909", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Grasshopper'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>WH, that&#8217;s great.

We want to see happiness and success if it is genuine. We all know that people are not 100% successful all of the time, nor are we 100% happy all of the time. A sincere communication won&#8217;t ignore those realities. But, if the message is too unrealistic, we tend to dismiss it as advertising.</p> <p>There&#8217;s a bumper sticker that says &#8220;I&#8217;m a Christian under construction&#8221;. What it&#8217;s trying to communicate is &#8211; I know I don&#8217;t get it right all the time, but I think I&#8217;m headed in the right direction. (Whether it successfully communicates that I leave to you.)</p> <p>I guess I&#8217;m encouraging Indies to be &#8220;real&#8221; with people when you&#8217;re promoting your faith. No one expects perfection.

Even though the show documented only a small tip of the iceberg, the modus operandi of the organization calling itself the &#8220;Church of Scientology&#8221; has been correctly observed and spotlighted.</p> <p>I find it important to note that the show did include coverage about the infamous text messages from the Office of the COB to his &#8220;church&#8221; staff, berating and invalidating dedicated Sea Org executives with obscenities.  This is significant because, even though the Organization of Scientology issued a statement that these text messgaes &#8220;could have been&#8221; (ooo loophole mania)   &#8220;forgeries&#8221;, and BBC dutifully included their soundbyte   statement,  one can surmise there is ample proof 1). these abusive text messages are in fact genuine, that the obscene insults were indeed texted from David Miscavige&#8217;s phone and 2) the office was in charge of and aware of  people who were off on intimidation and surveillance missions. to undermine and destroy.</p> <p> The text messages can be verified and proved. They are on record in actual phones and with the phone providers.  BBC obviously did their homework, and by verifying and reporting on the abusive texting and  surveillance  orders/games from the Office of COB,  proved validity of at least one of the many complaints of people leaving, i.e., verbal abuse and unethical abuse of power.     In they process, this simultaneously spotlighted the Organization as Habitual Liars.     And offers more credibility to some ground, i.e. &#8220;the secrets left on the cutting room floor&#8221;, that have yet to come to light, but for legal and practical reasons were circumvented.</p> <p>This abuse of people serving ideals and the betterment of life is deeply tragic and disappointing.  The abuse of persons asking for help is, bar none,  one of the most heinous travesties possible against human decency.</p> <p>My sentiments seeing this show were mixed: triumph for truth, justice, sadness, loss, admiration and &#8230;hope.    I admired everyone who communicated.  It was notable how much more radiant and well the Independent Scientologists are than those &#8220;inside.&#8221;  </p> <p>The operation of the trademarked brand Scientology emerges as sinister, abusive, and dishonest and run by a megolomaniac playing with people&#8217;s lives and black SUVS as though they were a Tonka toy collection pitted against make-believe (delusion or play, choose)  enemies.   It emerges this way not because of any bias a media reporter might have (wrong target), but because of the <i>proven documentation</i> of habitual, repeated transgressions against the mores of society and code of human decency &#8212; not to mention looking like a bunch of unenlightened, sickly  sourpusses.  </p> <p>I&#8217;m not saying this to be mean.  Come on! These are NOT the poster children for enlightenment. It was sad to see so many unhappy, uptight people.     However, it is not because of Scientology.   This is the tricky illusion that public awareness needs to grasp!  The irony is that people <i>outside</i>  the &#8220;Church&#8221;  are using the actual subject of Sceintology as it was developed and for the purposes it was intended, i.e. help and self-help. </p> <p>While the spotlight BBC directed toward  unconscionable and irresponsible behavior by a US Corporation was laudable, courageous, cutting edge journalism and successful,   I was very disappointed by the comic book representation of the intergalactic warlord .   </p> <p>Unlike others, I&#8217;m not offended by it, I&#8217;m merely disappointed at the inaccuracy of the depiction and hope this does not undermine the validity of excellent reporting, i.e. being the eyes of the world and all the duties and protocol of objectivity that entails.     The first inaccuracy about the outerspace stuff is that it this is touted as the crux of Scientology &#8212; it is not! The depiction is understandable from one POV (point of view):  it&#8217;s easier to wrap one&#8217;s mind around a cartoon in 30 seconds media time!  And we all love a good laugh.  And it is an easy, cheap shot at ceritfying some who would believe such a thing as nutty.   Right? </p> <p>I personally think good reporting broke down in that spot.  All that journalism would have required to fix that hole would have been the inclusion, even if brief and summarized, of the broader spectrum of the subject of Scientology, and also a brief parallel of similarity and differences of other religions as a comparison.  </p> <p>Here&#8217;s an example of how I think it failed:  The comic book illustrated sound-byte of &#8220;what Scientologists believe&#8221;  would be the same as if a show about the abuses of the Vatican, for example, depicted the Christian practice of Holy Mass as a cannibalistic ritual by people thinking they were drinking real blood and eating flesh of a man named Jesus Christ.   Yikes! There&#8217;s some iota of truth there, but it does not make it accurate.     The other disservice done by such a depiction would be that Mass is only one of many sacraments and  rituals practiced.</p> <p>But besides, a way that Scientology differs from many religions is that it is not based on beliefs.   </p> <p>My point is not to discuss Holy Communion as a metaphor, nor is it to examine the validity of any ritual a person chooses to employ that serves as a solution and instrument for betterment or understanding of existence and Life.   These are largely personal matters.</p> <p>Where religion stops being a personal matter to respect in others is where it crosses the line into intrusion and abuse of people.  Then it becomes public.   And that is what the BBC has successfully platformed.  I can only hope the public at large can differentiate between the subject.    The reality is that most people already <i>do</i> make the distinction between spirituality and religion.  Why?  Because religions have a history of being hijacked and altered for personal gain by delusional and corrupt dictators.  So I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s too big a leap for viewers watching the show to make.</p> <p>Yes,  it&#8217;s somewhat primitive to see a subject I understand, such as Scientology, a subject that holds merit and is efficient, be  reduced to a few yuks of a media sound-byte&#8230;but I&#8217;m not going to pull an Anne Archer over it;)  lol      </p> <p>As for life on other planets,  hey, yestedray the first Earth-like planet revolving a sun was discovered, and the astrophysicist who discovered it states he&#8217;s 100% sure it has the conditions for Life. </p> <p>I hope to see many discussions about Scientology and the nature of life amongst well-meaning people.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-martyrathbun09 comment-author-is-site-member bypostauthor odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52861"> 		<div id="comment-52861"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c2d94d163a566268e73c8b0195b6c03a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">martyrathbun09</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52861"> 				September 30, 2010 at 11:45 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52861#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52861", "52861", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to martyrathbun09'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Great analysis V.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52872"> 		<div id="comment-52872"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2fb4b1135fe28557060ab78b6f1f42b7?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://leavingscientology.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>OnceUponaTime</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52872"> 				October 1, 2010 at 12:27 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52872#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52872", "52872", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to OnceUponaTime'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Veritas,</p> <p>Talk about giving hope!

Excellent analysis.</p> <p>Re the OT III story. I don&#8217;t like the cartoon, but as an OT, I really do not know how to handle this if it comes up. I personally would say &#8220;no comment,&#8221; politely. I am not comfortable talking about it in conversation (not that I have) but, mainly because it was so drilled into me on the OT III course that it is under covers. And, I do believe that people can key in to this stuff, just like they key in to the clam and other incidents. But now, OT levels are publicized and everywhere, but from what I read, incomplete and fairly inaccurate, and always out of context. The only ones who tell the story are the detractors, so they, in effect, are defining what OT is for the public. </p> <p>I understand the reason and the point of OT III, and I got a serious amount of gain from it. But, all you see is the sensation and a shocking story.</p> <p>I will say that having people totally denying any part of it is stupid and ineffective.

Yes, I agree. I would never deny it. It is a stupid thing to do. </p> <p>By the way, the whole subject of entities and beings is not at all new. Christ made a habit of driving demons out of people. There is the famous incident where the crazy man with hundreds of demons came up to Jesus, and the demons asked to be cast out by Him, and put into a herd of swine. Jesus did, and the whole herd ran down into a lake and drowned. The man the demons were inhabiting became sane spread the Good News. The bible is full of stories like this.</p> <p>It isn&#8217;t only Christians, either &#8211; The old testament has as many demons as the new. There are demons everywhere!</p> <p>Not that OT III has to do with demons, just that there are some parallels.</p> <p>Here is a question for Scientologists and all those that believe in Past Lives to consider, while I am on the subject: </p> <p>There are six billion people on Earth. About 50,000 years ago, there were only 25 thousand people on Earth. How can we all have lived before on this planet? Where did the 5.99 billion other beings come from?</p> <p>A point to ponder!</p> <p>I have theories.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-6 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-53704"> 		<div id="comment-53704"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e9c95c80e61c125066483f55d04581b6?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Valkov</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-53704"> 				October 4, 2010 at 4:56 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=53704#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-53704", "53704", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Valkov'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>It&#8217;s a big universe, and not necessarily the only universe,  either.

The depiction is understandable from one POV (point of view): its easier to wrap ones mind around a cartoon in 30 seconds media time! And we all love a good laugh. And it is an easy, cheap shot at ceritfying some who would believe such a thing as nutty. Right? </i></p> <p>V, here&#8217;s why I think non-Scientologists will often say that OTIII is the crux of Scientology:</p> <p>1) In the Judeo-Christian religions, the book of Genesis &#8211; and particularly the first 3 chapters &#8211; form the foundation. There we learn who we are in relation to God and all of creation. There we learn who we are! We are created, not the Creator. But we alone among creation have been made &#8220;in the image of&#8221; God (Imago Dei). That means there is something about the human that is like God. Like God, we are spiritual beings. Like God, we are creative. Etc.</p> <p>When people from western cultures come at religion, it is natural for them to want the scientology equivalent of genesis.  And subconsciously, the probably means they expect a STORY that answers some of the biggest quesitons. ie. Who does Scientology say we are? What does Scientology say about God? </p> <p>OTIII is a story and it is the closest thing people have seen to being Scientology&#8217;s genesis.</p> <p>2) OTIII was given power because it was made mysterious and called &#8220;the Wall of Fire&#8221;.  </p> <p>3) The church did not explain what IS the crux of scientology.  The boilerplate &#8220;Man is a spiritual being &#8230; (yada) &#8230; visit an org, buy a book&#8221; is really a non-explanation.  It leaves a vacuum that is still not filled. </p> <p>So while OTIII does cause a lot of mirth, I do not think that those labelling it the crux of scientology do so with any ill intent. Or at least, I can see how they could very innocently reach that conclusion.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-53003"> 		<div id="comment-53003"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3b7ce26a18fece865bf84652fbc083cc?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Grasshopper</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-53003"> 				October 1, 2010 at 3:33 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=53003#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-53003", "53003", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Grasshopper'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>OT III is one level of many. There were seventeen years between 1950 and 1967. Virtually all of Scientology was researched and released before OT III. The &#8220;crux&#8221; of Scientology, the Genesis, if you will, is in the Logics, the Factors, the Axioms, and the Theta-MEST theory from Science of Survival, not OT III. </p> <p>OT III could be considered to be a commonly shared experience for some people. While important, it is not fundamental. I spent sixteen very productive and enlightened years in Scientology before I did OT III. I had a lot of gain on OT III as mentioned above. But I got much, much more from the fundamentals I listed above than I did from OT III. </p> <p>Your point 2 above is correct &#8211; if it wasn&#8217;t under wraps, it would not be such a prize for journalists. I often wondered why the History of Man stories were not more publicized. Perhaps because it was out in the open. </p> <p>Your point 3 is very valid. I huge flaw in the church is that people will not answer questions &#8211; when they should. &#8220;What is Scientology?&#8221; &#8220;Here, read this!&#8221; &#8220;Here, read  this!&#8221; is not a real answer. It is part of the answer, but not the only answer. So, naturally, when there is a vacuum of information, people will fill it with whatever they can find.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-5 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-54282"> 		<div id="comment-54282"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e4b4bbe3e09f5e00c8061846bd634296?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Heather G</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-54282"> 				October 6, 2010 at 11:30 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=54282#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-54282", "54282", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Heather G'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I hear you, Grasshopper.

There were 4 people on that show (Marty, Mike, Amy, Marc) who have either seen or experienced the beating first hand, and you can bet they will have told the BBC all about it, including maybe some new details we had not heard before.</p> <p>For those wondering why it didn&#8217;t make the edit, it was simply because of legal issues. Sweeney would have LOVED to have nailed it to Miscavige, and it doesn&#8217;t matter that the general public don&#8217;t know who he is, Sweeney would have absolutely delighted in telling the world that the leader of Scientology beats people up on a regular basis.</p> <p>The best he could do was reveal the swearing. Why? Because he had evidence, because the BBC could read the messages. Do you think if Sweeney bothered to broadcast swearwords on his show, he would not broadcast allegations of violence from a &#8220;pope&#8221; if he could? He would HAVE LOVED TO!!!!! </p> <p>I assume these legal wranglings have been the reason for the delayed broadcast of the show.</p> <p>Sooner or later, someone who has signed one of those affidavits  saying they never saw DM beat anyone up will blow. Then another, then another. It will be interesting to see how these broadcasters (CNN, BBC) react to someone who says &#8220;I know I said that, I&#8217;m sorry, but it wasn&#8217;t true. Here&#8217;s why I had to sign it, and yes I have seen the bruises&#8221;.</p> <p>It&#8217;s a real shame Tommy Davis didn&#8217;t jump out the back of one of those cars to confront Sweeney &#8211; that really would have been awesome.</p> <p>Where is Tommy these days by the way, has he blown again or is he in at the moment, it&#8217;s so hard to keep track of the guy! In, out, in, out &#8211; the guy must be dizzy.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52833"> 		<div id="comment-52833"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d87a407c7cd2f661a84dfbb5023f79f5?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Rory Medford</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52833"> 				September 30, 2010 at 9:37 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52833#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52833", "52833", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Rory Medford'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Sad but true the members keep drinking the kool-aid<br /> DM must have really sweet tasting kool-aid</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52871"> 		<div id="comment-52871"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2aa10f8fc147d78db0af8efcdb528132?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://chuckbeatty77.webs.com/index.htm' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Chuck Beatty</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52871"> 				October 1, 2010 at 12:25 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52871#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52871", "52871", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Chuck Beatty'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;d like to have seen JB interviewed, to get the latest on Int Base from JB&#8217;s own mouth, on camera.</p> <p>When&#8217;s JB gonna be interviewed by media?</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-ahgrasshopper odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52888"> 		<div id="comment-52888"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3b7ce26a18fece865bf84652fbc083cc?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://ahgrasshopper.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Grasshopper</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52888"> 				October 1, 2010 at 1:49 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52888#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52888", "52888", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Grasshopper'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I finally had a chance to look at this &#8211; I do have a day job, after all!</p> <p>Well, I don&#8217;t know what you all were expecting with this, but I for one am really happy with it.

It really is. It shows the passing of the baton of real Scientology from the church, to the Reformers. I&#8217;d love to hear your takes on this, but I really think that is the case.</p> <p>I was thinking &#8211; when I was younger, and something weird would happen when I was on staff or on course, I would think to myself &#8211; &#8220;That&#8217;s not Scientology.&#8221; Since I was trained well at an early age, I knew enough to know what was and what was not &#8220;kosher&#8221; from a tech point of view.</p> <p>When I saw shows on TV (the ABC show in 1976 was  the first I really noticed, but then there was 60 minutes and other shows), I would not recognize what the show was passing off as Scientology. I had done training, I was auditing and audited, I knew the value of the meter, of clay demos, of doll drills. To see this stuff paraded as somehow crazy made no sense to me, and pissed me off.</p> <p>That changed. Later shows and news article showed things I had seen, but that I knew were not kosher Scn. So, I would still say &#8211; &#8220;but, but, that&#8217;s NOT really what it is!&#8221;</p> <p>I remember in 1982, there was an Supercargo (I think) at ASHOF who was really cute, but pure SO. She had recruiting targets &#8211; had to get people on staff as SO. I was seeing her about some ethics issue or another, and an emergency came up. GET THIS:</p> <p>In order to meet the recruiting targets, an ASHO Van would go down to skid row in Los Angeles every night, ask homeless people if they had even done LSD, and if  they hadn&#8217;t, they would recruit them into the SO by telling them they would have nice food and a place to stay. So, the emergency was that there was a fight when the evening&#8217;s catch came in. They were fighting over a bottle of wine. This shocked the hell out of me. It was like seeing a stripper with her makeup off. I actually saw this.</p> <p>So, as shows happened and articles were printed (the Penthouse article with Nibs, the Time article), each time I could see that, yes, some of these things happened, but they are not really Scientology.</p> <p>Well. Here&#8217;s the rub. Now, I have to say that, yes, now it IS Scientology. What you see on Sweeney&#8217;s show is what &#8220;Scientology&#8221; has become. I can no longer defend it as I did before by saying what you saw was an aberration. Unfortunately, it is the reality. What I do is the &#8220;aberration.&#8221;</p> <p>So, since a thetan never quits, and we are thetans after all, I can now point at the whole church and say: &#8220;That&#8217;s not Scientology! We are!&#8221;</p> <p>This is a watershed for us, folks. I truly believe it.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-53006"> 		<div id="comment-53006"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/35c099a407c6bcb69554239271f5ded7?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Margaret</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-53006"> 				October 1, 2010 at 3:52 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=53006#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-53006", "53006", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Margaret'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Holy sh!t, they actually <i>did</i> that at ASHOF?

For example, Wiccans might practice White Magic, which is intended to grant beingness and enhance livingness,  promote health and ARC.   The ends do NOT justify the means.</p> <p>Black Magic is the callous, unethical, and basically &#8220;selfish&#8221; use of knowledge to gain and keep power by harming, enslaving, destroying. </p> <p>Anyone can understand this distinction,  it is strong in the cultures of Earth.  Witness Jedi vs. Sith in the Star Wars saga.</p> <p>No-one wants to think evil really does exist, but in fact regimes like NorthKorea and much of 20th century history shows it does exist.</p> <p>It is fairly well established that the CoS is a &#8220;cult&#8221; or has strong cult-like elements.</p> <p>Perhaps what we most need to do now, in addtion to exposing those cult-like elements, is hammer on the idea that what theCoS isnow doing and practicing is NOT SCIENTOLOGY.</p> <p>They are still calling it &#8220;scientology&#8221; BUT it is NOT.   It is REVERSE scientology,  comparable to other abusive Black practices that are not intended to help anyone.</p> <p>We also need to keep putting it out that REAL Scientology, the &#8220;White&#8221;  kind,  does exist,  is being freely practiced outside the CoS and is doing a lot of good.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-53147"> 		<div id="comment-53147"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3b7ce26a18fece865bf84652fbc083cc?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Grasshopper</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-53147"> 				October 2, 2010 at 7:57 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=53147#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-53147", "53147", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Grasshopper'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yes, Valkov.

Answer that seriously, and you have what you really care about. </p> <p>If you would jettison your family just to get a crack at OT VIII or IX, what kind of person are you? How incredibly self-centered is that? The Church is basically saying that it is right and good that you should walk across the crushed skulls of your friends and family to get to some elusive OT level, to indulge in an orgy of &#8220;ME!&#8221; </p> <p>Sorry, the road to Truth does not lead that way! </p> <p>People are more important than any idea that ever existed.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-53178"> 		<div id="comment-53178"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f0fada286f456827d2daf5a5109e370a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Wayne Froemke (AKA "Safe")</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-53178"> 				October 2, 2010 at 11:32 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=53178#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-53178", "53178", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Wayne Froemke (AKA &quot;Safe&quot;)'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Grasshopper wrote, &#8220;But, the reality is that we have an out of control narcissist running the Church&#8221;</p> <p>Grasshopper,</p> <p>You are so way too nice in your understatement of DM.</p> <p>May I have the liberty to beef up the sentence a bit? <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p> <p>&#8220;Fully Loaded&#8221; version</p> <p>We have an out-of-control, narcissistic &#8220;mother of all squirrels&#8221;, malevolent little-man dictator monopolizing Scientology.</p> <p>Thank you.

They ought not be referred to as doing any kind of &#8220;scientology&#8221; at all,  because they are not.</p> <p>We need to clearly state not that they are doing it wrong,  but that they are not doing it AT ALL.   They are calling it &#8220;scientology&#8221; but are actually doing something else entirely.</p> <p>That is in fact what all the posts on  these blogs and sites are about,  but they are couched in technical language that wouldn&#8217;t communicate to the non-technical publics.</p> <p>We need to learn to communicate the facts in a non-technical way.  that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m proposing.</p> <p>The public obviously would not be into all the fine points  of how GAT altered the tech etc. They would go to sleep on explanations of that.</p> <p>But there are enough highly trained people who have left/been purged/driven out of the official CoS  for Independents to publicly take a position such as I am suggesting:   </p> <p>&#8220;We left because the CoS is no longer doing Scientology at all.  They are doing mind control and behavior modification to make money and that&#8217;s all .&#8221;</p> <p>I think the BBC show is a good step in that direction.</p> <p>We do want to avoid the &#8220;sect vs.sect&#8221; perception. I don&#8217;t know if it is entirely avoidable.  I believe the best way to do that is not even grant the CoS  the beingness of a &#8220;sect&#8221; of Scientology.  They are not even a sect of Scientology.  They are a scam.  They appropriated the &#8220;Scientology&#8221; name and are doing a &#8220;bait and switch&#8221; by doing behavior modification and mind control instead of Scientology.</p> <p> The idea of a &#8220;Reformation&#8221;  is good.   By analogy,  the CoS is all about &#8220;selling indulgences&#8221;, ie, all about money and power,  just as the Catholic Church was then, when Martin Luther took action.   But how many people even know or care what the Reformation was?</p> <p>I&#8217;m talking about how do we communicate with the average non-scientologist person?   How do we say,  &#8220;I&#8217;m a Scientologist.&#8221; ?</p> <p>Inevitably, we&#8217;ll get back &#8220;Ewww!   You&#8217;re one of THEM!!!!?&#8221;.   So how do we say &#8220;No, I&#8217;m not one of them. I am a Scientologist.  They are not Scientologists.  They are  a brainwashing cult pretending to be Scientologists.&#8221;</p> <p>That&#8217;s the issue I&#8217;m struggling with.   I&#8217;m guessing there are many others in this same boat with me.</p> <p>It is related to the  issue of what to say to folks I know who are still in the CoS.  I am about to the point of bluntly saying I believe the CoS is a squirrel group.   Turn about is fair play.   The CoS &#8220;party line&#8221; reminds me of the old saw about Soviet Union &#8211; you could always tell what they were up to,  by what they accused other countries of doing.</p> <p>Well, &#8220;I&#8217;m made of rubber, you&#8217;re made of glue,  everything you(the CoS) say bounces off of me (the Independents) and sticks to you&#8221;,  is pretty much how I see it.  Why not simply reverse the flow, is what I am asking myself.</p> <p>Is it time to start turning the tide?   Is it time for an OT Committee of Independents to call another Comm Ev of David Musthavage?   All the charges of the one held in 1984 are still valid, and many more by now.</p> <p>Are we getting near the point of nailing the Ethics Orders up on the Church&#8217;s doors?</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-5 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-53402"> 		<div id="comment-53402"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f0fada286f456827d2daf5a5109e370a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Wayne Froemke (AKA "Safe")</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-53402"> 				October 3, 2010 at 12:40 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=53402#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-53402", "53402", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Wayne Froemke (AKA &quot;Safe&quot;)'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Valkov wrote, &#8220;Are we getting near the point of nailing the Ethics Orders up on the Churchs doors?&#8221;</p> <p>LOL.

I believe they should know. The real secrets are uglier than most good people can likely conceive the evil of, or confront. As hard as it may be to swallow, I will make my own attempt to help point them to it.</p> <p>More accurately, the BBC Panorama show should really be called &#8230;</p> <p>&#8220;The Secrets of the CofS and Reverse Scientology&#8221;</p> <p>The program just barely skimmed the very surface of the secrets.</p> <p>Keep in mind when you read the rest here, what I refer to is <b>not</b> really Scientology, but truly REVERSE Scientology &#8230; the exact opposite of what L. Ron Hubbard intended (IMO), and the organization (CofS) who applies it.</p> <p>If you haven&#8217;t already, watch the North Korea videos I posted above, first. </p> <p><a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52471" rel="nofollow">https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52471</a></p> <p>Many aware Sea Org staff (who have most likely already cognited and are out of CofS) will likely verify the similarities between the North Korea government and its People, and the governance of CofS and its Staff and members.</p> <p>Perhaps the People of the country who are most aware of the tragedy of Totalitarian rule are the good People of Germany. Clearly, they do not want to experience a tragic repeat of what happened already in their Country. So they are hyper aware, and never want to lose their Democracy again.</p> <p>So no wonder why it stands to reason the CofS and Scientology have been severely scrutinized by German scholars. </p> <p>Realize though, when they mention &#8220;Scientology&#8221;, they are really talking about CofS and Reverse Scientology (IMO). This will especially help Scientologists be able to read through this without being offended. I don&#8217;t read into the following work as an insult to the goodness of the science of (white) Scientology itself &#8230; the &#8220;science of knowing how to know&#8221;.</p> <p>I believe this will explain to Scientologists and non-Scientologists alike how church Scientologists can be put into a &#8220;coma&#8221; and stay in it &#8230;</p> <p><a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:upfOa8Gigf4J:www.stmi.bayern.de/imperia/md/content/stmi/sicherheit/verfassungsschutz/scientology/system_so_engl.pdf+scientology+/system_so_engl.pdf&#038;hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:upfOa8Gigf4J:www.stmi.bayern.de/imperia/md/content/stmi/sicherheit/verfassungsschutz/scientology/system_so_engl.pdf+scientology+/system_so_engl.pdf&#038;hl=en</a></p> <p>The PDF version &#8230;</p> <p><a href="http://www.stmi.bayern.de/imperia/md/content/stmi/sicherheit/verfassungsschutz/scientology/system_so_engl.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.stmi.bayern.de/imperia/md/content/stmi/sicherheit/verfassungsschutz/scientology/system_so_engl.pdf</a></p> <p>I don&#8217;t pronounce the truth of ALL of it, but there is a lot of truth, IMO. It seems as if it is virtually a BLUEPRINT of what DM is doing. I understand some Scientologists will deny this can be. But personally, the more I look and confront this, the more real and true this is to me.</p> <p>In no way am I questioning LRH&#8217;s intent. I think his intent got twisted totally backwards, of which <b>he even warned us about this!</b> It is no wonder to me that the German People fear this trap, and perhaps even a repeat of their nightmare which could be potentially worse, especially if expanded globally.</p> <p>Exerpt &#8230;</p> <p>&#8220;Its activities have come into conflict with democratic societies around the world and continue to do so. After an in-depth examination, an Investigative Commission titled &#8220;So-called Sects and Psycho-Groups&#8221; set up by the German Bundestag (Parliament) described the organization in its final report as an anti-constitutional movement with a criminogenic structure. This evaluation is in agreement with that of the German forces of order. </p> <p>(<b>crim·i·no·gen·ic</b> adj. Producing or tending to produce crime or criminality)</p> <p>&#8220;Behind the cloak of a new religion, this organization  described as a psycho-group and not as a religious community by the Investigative Commission  was able to skillfully hide its salient structural traits until recently, namely organization and logistics of a commercial corporation; expansionist strategies of an aggressively functioning structural distribution system (marketing of franchises by forming chains of subsidiary companies, hard-selling of human leadership and change in the form of social engineering.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;In other words, ruthless of psychological and social techniques borrowed from behavioral psychology in order to recruit workers, customers and members; <i>use of totalitarian organization techniques to thoroughly discipline and intrumentalize its workers by constant control in terms of time and space.&#8221;</i></p> <p>(Italics mine)</p> <p>Whenever such procedures are purposely used to manipulate and harm a person (see &#8220;Newspeak&#8221; in Orwell&#8217;s 1984), the science of psychology loses its quality as a therapeutic and pedagogical means of assistance and becomes nothing more than an <i>insidious weapon.</i></p> <p>The most spectacular instance of the effectiveness of the behavioral methods is when the political or philosophical convictions of a prisoner are altered to suit the program of a torturer applying torture that leaves no physical traces on the body (so-called psycho-torture). This is how American POWs in the Korean War were &#8220;converted&#8221; to Communist<br /> ideology, and how Stalin&#8217;s supporters who had fallen from grace were made to publicly confess their enmity towards the state  which was non-existent in reality  and to declare their guilt.</p> <p>But even people who are not being coerced can be subjected to methods borrowed from behavioral psychology and have their will sapped or even their personality destroyed. This was demonstrated by the campaign against dissidence waged by the Stasi (the former East German secret police), who used a scientific program developed by behavioral psychologists to &#8220;disintegrate the psyche.&#8221; The victims of these methods of psychological torture suffer of the consequences to this day.</p> <p>It has been proven that Scientology uses similar procedures (&#8220;techniques&#8221;) on the one hand to make individuals pliable and to discipline its members, and on the other hand to attack its critics, who are seen as enemies, in order to silence them and obstruct them in their activities against the organization. The damage caused by such methods  which is being investigated by human and social scientists under the heading of &#8220;mobbing&#8221;  has already made itself felt in the world of business.</p> <p>What is particularly worrisome, as it is incompatible with the democratic world order, is the fact that management trainers who believe in a Darwinistic corporate and social philosophy teach these methods to their customers in courses in order to turn them into &#8220;battle managers&#8221; ready for the &#8220;business war.&#8221;</p> <p>If a candidate is not informed as to the main or side effects of strategies that modify behavior, or, as is the case with Scientology, purposely deceived about those effects, he or she will as a rule find it hard to differentiate between normal instructional techniques and &#8220;forced instruction&#8221; or brainwashing. It is especially reprehensible when repressive<br /> techniques are purposely applied by the user to cause harm or accept harm as an outcome, and are disguised as &#8220;healing measures.&#8221;</p> <p> When fully unfolded, the authoritarian personality manifests the<br /> following features: Reacts to commands in totalitarian systems: the authoritarian personality gives orders to perform inhuman measures without feeling any scruples, or will carry such measures out on being ordered to do so for the maintenance or expansion of the system&#8217;s<br /> power. As a rule, he does not care whether these measures violate human rights or moral laws. He is satisfied to justify his actions by stating that they serve the system or are sanctioned by it. The authoritarian image of the human being is therefore in fundamental contradiction to the democratic one.</p> <p>Even long after leaving the organization, some of the former members who served as functionaries or were customers of the organization for many years complain of feeling cold inside and of lacking feelings. Relatives of Scientologists already note a change in their relatives&#8217; personalities shortly after they came in contact with the organization. They describe their behavior as &#8220;coldly calculating,&#8221; &#8220;robotlike,&#8221; &#8220;mechanical,&#8221; or complain of<br /> &#8220;cynical&#8221; or even &#8220;sadistic&#8221; personal behavior. And even after leaving the organization15 similar behavior has been reported. Whether this attitude is the result of a neurotic illness still needs to be investigated.</p> <p>The phenomenon that most former functionaries and long-standing members have the hardest time explaining is why during their membership they considered critics of the system as true enemies, even if they were their closest relatives, and why they tried by all means to silence them as troublemakers.</p> <p>This cannot only be deduced from the development of an authoritarian personality structure. Some former members pointed out that in keeping with the system&#8217;s doctrine, they considered their own welfare, &#8220;survival,&#8221; would be in jeopardy if they broke off ties with the organization in obeyance to the wishes of their relatives.</p> <p>Creating this attitude is one of the manipulative strategies of the system, which thereby <i>immunizes its members against incoming criticism.</i> It&#8217;s actually a well-tried social technique repeatedly used by totalitarian regimes. The idea is to make a dogma of close ties to the regime and of its continued existence as a vital commodity necessary for survival in order to<br /> recruit champions and soldiers for the defense and expansion of the system.&#8221;</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52942"> 		<div id="comment-52942"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f0fada286f456827d2daf5a5109e370a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Wayne Froemke (AKA "Safe")</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52942"> 				October 1, 2010 at 7:36 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52942#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52942", "52942", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Wayne Froemke (AKA &quot;Safe&quot;)'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>That the CofS is totally run by ruthless totalitarian methods by an ultimate dictator absurdly violates any idea of true religious community, doesn&#8217;t it?</p> <p>Perhaps that&#8217;s the biggest and most obvious CofS outpoint of all.</p> <p>Can it be any wonder why many object to this?</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52957"> 		<div id="comment-52957"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a98c913614cd24aa56f36d7f15d25213?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://xenu.net' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>J.

This episode showed the humanity of Scientologists who have left CoS. What stood out to me was the contrast between  people who are still in, such as Tommy Davis and the SO Stepford Wives, and people who have left. It is obvious to even the casual observer that active CoS members are angry, defensive, dishonest, and manipulative. It was stunning to listen to Mike and Marty narrate the Op on John Sweeney and describe how Tommy pushed his &#8220;bigot&#8221; button. When footage was shown of Tommy pushing the button over and over on John, this was proof of the  manipulative and sadistic behavior in which active CoS members will engage. Tommy Davis is dishonorable, dishonest, and vicious. If Tommy Davis is what the Church of Scientology does to people, who wants that? Who wants to sign up to be a cunning, malicious thug? That is who Tommy Davis is: He is a vile Scientology hoodlum. </p> <p>2. Mike Rinder looked skeletal in 2007. He looked like someone who was in a POW camp. When Mike said, &#8220;I just couldn&#8217;t take it anymore,&#8221; his admission came from a deep and painful place in his soul. When Mike said that, I suddenly realized that RPF is in fact a POW camp whose sole purpose is to break people by starving them, sleep depriving them, and crushing them. At one of the protests I saw Wally Burgess step off a SO bus and walk into the side door of the HGB. Wally had that same skeletal, scared POW look. Had I the chance to talk to him, I am certain that Wally would have defended CoS tooth and nail. </p> <p>3. The e-meter demonstration was necessary for context. It showed straightforward auditing as a technique. In CoS, however, auditing is often &#8220;weaponized&#8221; as a tool of intimidation and control. I have used the term &#8220;Weaponized Scientology&#8221; in other places to describe the Tech as a weapon CoS uses against its own members. The BBC episode showed that<br /> auditing, in and of itself, does not have to be predatory.</p> <p>4. The distinction of &#8220;Independent Scientologist&#8221; was established. Also established was the category of  people who left Scientology, do not practice it anymore, but believe in the right of other people to practice Scientology. These distinctions are important. </p> <p>5. Marc and Claire Headley really connected. I know Marc and Claire and think the world of them. They are brave, honest people who were both deeply harmed by CoS. Denied their day in court by a judge who was intellectually slovenly and therefore couldn&#8217;t be bothered to open up c0mplex religious questions, the brutality of David Miscavige remains a key topic in Culture relative to Scientology. OSA&#8217;s legal threats to the BBC permeated the episode to anyone who has followed the debate. The story of DM&#8217;s brutality is still very much in the public mind when it comes to the subject of Scientology. </p> <p>6. The Church of Scientology is a Cult. This fact was clear to the FDA in 1961; clear in 1971 to Paulette Cooper; clear to the FBI in 1977; clear to Matt Lauer in 2005; and it is clear to the BBC in 2010. For some reason, when the Tech and the &#8220;religious angle&#8221; are combined, abuse, greed, and criminality ensue. Scientology as &#8220;The Tech&#8221; simply does do well inside of a religious organization. While LRH built organizations and policy, I personally do not think he did a very good job of it. He cruelly underpaid and overworked his people while he and the Church became quite wealthy. He greenlighted Operation Snow White and that was illegal from the get go. LRH had the option of suing the US Government and using the media to expose Operation Cointelpro and other Ops. I cannot reconcile L. Ron Hubbard&#8217;s contradictions, and, I support the right of people to practice Scientology. If we disagree, it can be respectful. Moreover, I am always open to learning something new I don&#8217;t know. </p> <p>/////</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-52981"> 		<div id="comment-52981"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f0fada286f456827d2daf5a5109e370a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Wayne Froemke (AKA "Safe")</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/#comment-52981"> 				October 1, 2010 at 12:47 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2010/09/28/bbc-panorama-the-secrets-of-scientology/?replytocom=52981#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-52981", "52981", "respond", "3485" )' aria-label='Reply to Wayne Froemke (AKA &quot;Safe&quot;)'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;In CoS, however, auditing is often <b>weaponized</b> as a tool of intimidation and control.

Pointing out too much of the insanities going on all at once might of been unbelievable to most.</p> <p>I especially like the part were you  got out the e-meter and gave a demo.  You did a good job and it showed that you were not in disagreement with the Technology but the insanities going on in the Church.  This is a key issue for any public watching.</p> <p>The following by camera men and the rudeness by them via the church to a polite BBC commentator said it all.  Anyone who is at least trained on a basic communication course and the tone scale would find the handling of the commentator as an&#8221;unappropriated&#8221; use of ARC and the Tone Scale.  Then when you and Mike went over how the church uses buttons and cutting a person&#8217;s communication to get the person keyed-in then showed the videos of what was done to the commentator in the past  to purposely drive him nuts with altered tech&#8230;.that was priceless!  The poor guy still felt bad he got out of control with Tommy in that yelling match video and at least you gave him the truth of how he was being manipulated with altered tech.</p> <p>I know that if any public saw this series, some must be wondering what is going on in their church even if it is the back of their minds. No matter what propaganda the church is putting out, the church is covertly taking away rights of people.    The Creed of the Church of Scientology, you know the parts that states:</p> <p>We of the Church believe:  That all men have inalienable rights to think freely, to talk freely, to write freely their own opinions and to counter or utter or write upon the opinions of others;</p> <p>and</p> <p>We of the Church believe:  That all men have inalienable rights to their own lives;</p> <p>And that no agency less than God has the power to suspend or set aside these rights, overtly or covertly.</p> <p>There are no policies or laws or people that can trumps these rights!

Were the BBC to be sued by RTC&#8217;s Scientology for anything in Dispute, it would also reduce Panorama&#8217;s Credibility.</p> <p>Completely unbiased, nice personal Touch &#8230; a human side to this Story and factually very informative.</p> <p>Absent were the Agendas of Anon, Shrinks, Medicos, Deprogrammers, Politicians, Schmeckperts, Vested Interest Lobbies or any other avowed Enemies of Scientology in the making of this Piece. It wasn&#8217;t against Scientology, it was Anti-Cult.</p> <p>Neither Pro nor Counter Scientology based, it got right down to the actual and factual Issues surrounding the Organization/Cult of Scientology.</p> <p>In Fact all conflicting Parties involved were Subscribers of the Scientology Technology, be it Mike, Marty, Tommy, Dave, Amy, Celebs, etc. Only the PIs and the BBC Reporter weren&#8217;t. The BBC gave Scientology Technology the Floor this Time around, and was probably the very first large-scale Scientology Cult vs. Scientology Freezone/Independent Piece. It&#8217;s historic.</p> <p>Even a few CO$ Parishioners had their Minute in the Sun to tell of their Success with Scientology.</p> <p>And how did the Church respond? By making a personal Soap Opera Circus out of it by insinuating Mike Rinder&#8217;s &amp; John Sweeney&#8217;s Motives were based on a desperate Need of scratching each other&#8217;s Backs, making this the least effective non-factual Counter-Campaign the Church has ever delivered. Not one Thing the BBC stated was refuted, not one single Thing. This Time the Church took the low Road.</p> <p>Although I have no Love for Official Scientology, I despise any Newspiece that deals in Lies, regardless in whose favor it is. That being said, the 2007 Segment Sweeney did was pure Trash, and he well deserved the flogging he got for it from all Sides. I&#8217;m happy to see he make good with this Documentary, and enjoyed it so much I watched it 3 Times.

They don&#8217;t have suicide bombers or any of the things the other 3 bigger religious have.  I don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;s dangerous at all.  So they interrupt the guy when he talks.  Sheesh.  So they follow him (their dime for the gas).  SO WHAT?  Are they shooting bullets at him?  Xianity, some forms of it, are seriously dangeorus in that it causes real repression and neurosis.  Going against the &#8220;cult of pro Israel&#8221; CAN be dangeorus to your health and job and career, too.  Going against Islam can get you killed.  I don&#8217;t hear ANY of that happening with scientology.  And no, I&#8217;m not a member of that or any other religious cult.  I&#8217;m not the type of personality to join stuff like that where nothing for ME to gain up front is there.  Take the Moose Club.  You GET quite a bit for  your 20 bucks a year, especially if you want to go to a club where there is a band and dancing, food, drinks, etc.  That kind of thing I&#8217;d join.</p> </div>  	</div><!--
