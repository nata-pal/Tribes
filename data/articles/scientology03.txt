Ron Hubbard’s version of Nietzsche’s superman or Aleister Crowley’s magician).<em>Note:  Scientology is at first presented in secular, scientific terms promising and then false reporting 100% workability.  In fact scientology never achieved even the scientifically recognized 20 to 30 percent placebo effect in terms of long-term satisfaction.  In order to explain away that discrepancy the less-than-placebo percentage who stick with it are led to adopt the remaining listed beliefs.  The ‘technology’ evolved being carefully designed and administered so as to lead scientologists to wholeheartedly accept and live according to these beliefs.</em></li> </ol> <p>2.  Planet Earth is a prison. The vast majority of human beings &#8211; and billions of             invisible other beings &#8211; are its inmates.</p> <p>3.  Xenu is the name of scientology’s Satan who established Earth as                                  a <span style="color:#444444;line-height:1.7;">prison and transported billions of beings to serve as its inmates.</span></p> <p>4.  Our continued imprisonment is assured by ‘psychs.’ ‘Psychs’ are                                    defined as psychiatrists, psychologists, psycho-therapists, priests,                                ministers, and anyone else practicing in the field of the mind and                                  spirit.  Psychs were sent here from a planet called ‘Farsec.’  They are a                        special breed of being created and invested with the sole purpose of                            keeping humankind mentally imprisoned.</p> <p>5.  Ron Hubbard is the first to discover the above ‘truths’, and the only                             one to have devised a means of escaping the prison planet.</p> <p>6.  Navigation through the only hole in the wall consists of closely                                        emulating Hubbard and behaving as he did when he lived.</p> <p>7.  Enemies, including psychs as well as anyone expressing any doubt or                           reservation about these beliefs, must be destroyed by any means                                  necessary by scientologists. Such means include lying, suing, cheating,                        harassing, intimidating, blackmailing, smearing and by physical                                      violence.</p> <p>8. When a scientologist has expended all of his best efforts in the vain                             pursuit of these beliefs he is expected to ‘discard’ his body so that he                           may continue to pursue them without such a physical ‘impediment’.</p> <p>Whether the ultimate belief, number 8 above, constitutes suicide is a wholly subjective question of religious belief.</p> <div

There are multiple factual points where Ron was dishonest and/or fraudulent. There are zero objective, scientific validations of the results of Dianetics or Scientology. There is not a single proven clear or OT as originally defined by Ron, not one after six decades of opportunity.</p> <p>Pointing this brutal truth out does not demean others. Rather it provides a necessary wake up call to our fellow human beings.</p> <p>That&#8217;s not to say that Scientology cannot lead to many realizations and insights. I think it can and does. Unfortunately, it also leads to delusion and the totalitarian stifling of free thought.</p> <p>Where Scientology ultimately sinks itself is that it makes both religious and scientific claims. Scientific claims are falsifiable in any number of ways. Religious claims are not.</p> <p>Most religions keep themselves off the hook by limiting their ultimate claims to an unfalsifiable afterlife. Their current life claims are typically very subjective and debatable. They often include claims like being a better person, being happier, feeling in touch with God, and so on.</p> <p>While Scientology also claims betterment of one&#8217;s internal state, and makes claims of a better afterlife or afterlives, it unfortunately also makes a slew of easily falsifiable current life claims. </p> <p>These include, but are not limited to things like: increased IQ, freedom from psychosomatic disease, better eyesight, better health overall, immunity from lung cancer caused by smoking, becoming radiation proof, drug treatment programs with 70 to 80% effectiveness, the ability to the exteriorise from one&#8217;s body at will and do so with full perceptics, past life recall, ability to change the world through postulates, super powers, perfect recall, longer lifespans, greater wealth, greater creativity, the ability to control MEST both objectively and subjectively as well as the ability to control life and thought. And so many more implicit and explicit claims, most or all of which could be verified through objective research if they were real.</p> <p>While there are nuggets along the road, Scientology&#8217;s promised gold mine never quite materializes. The bridge becomes a circle, a hamster wheel. Escherlike, the lizard of the organization circles back on its own tail (and tale), and begins to cannibalize itself. The lack of the ultimate results is hidden behind unfalsifiable gnosticism. The attention of the faithful is misdirected to supposed enemies and false causes as to why the results are never achieved. The hopes of the faithful slowly turn to self betrayal in stubborn persistence of belief.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-iamvalkov even depth-7 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330314"> 		<div id="comment-330314"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/742817c1603c6e5f9f5086f4763a57b5?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://valkovuddin.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>iamvalkov</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330314"> 				February 19, 2015 at 2:36 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330314#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330314", "330314", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to iamvalkov'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m not disagreeing ,  but I feel many if not most of the &#8220;objective&#8221; claims have not been systematically tested.

Let&#8217;s take IQ claims. Ron said IQ definitely goes up with hours of auditing. There are standardized, non-Scientology tests to measure IQ. A comprehensive test can take several hours and cost some money to administer. And the church reportedly has billions of dollars at its disposal.</p> <p>The church has made a claim about to IQ through its &#8220;scripture&#8221; and therefore the onus is on the church to prove its claim (that is just how burden of proof works). It has the resources and the self interest to prove its claim. The church could easily set up a program where a standard IQ test is given by external experts before auditing and then at one or more points in time as auditing progressed.</p> <p>Without getting into supernatural powers, metaphysical knowledge, past life recall, testing IQ improvement would be a pretty straightforward and standard way of validating or falsifying this particular claim.</p> <p>If the church and its believers are positive that the words of Hubbard are infallible scripture, why would it hesitate to do such testing? It has plenty of money to fund such a project. And every self interest in doing so. In fact, if the claims proved to be true that would spur worldwide positive interest in the church and its teachings. So not performing such research could be argued to be an overt of omission.</p> <p>As I reflect on this it strikes me that Miscavige&#8217;s focus on MEST acquisition could be taken as the signal that he himself does not believe in the ultimate claims of Scientology &#8212; or even some of the more pedestrian claims. Therefore he would rather buy impressive buildings than perform research that would pull the rug out from under his own feet.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329519"> 		<div id="comment-329519"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ecd994d7f918147adaa53571480babdb?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://deleted' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Brian</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329519"> 				February 5, 2015 at 3:04 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329519#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329519", "329519", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Brian'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Sign me up.

Ron Hubbard in the late 1940s, a few years before he established Dianetics (1950) or Scientology (1952). They consist of a series of statements by and addressed to Hubbard, relating to various physical, sexual, psychological and social issues that he was encountering in his life. After the Affirmations became public knowledge in 1984 the Church of Scientology has disputed their authenticity, though in legal papers it has described the Affirmations as having been &#8220;written by&#8221; Hubbard and sought to retain ownership of them. The Affirmations appear to have been intended to be used as a form of self-hypnosis with the intention of resolving the author&#8217;s psychological problems and instilling a positive mental attitude. They are closely linked to the occult philosophy of Thelema, devised by Aleister Crowley in the early 20th century, in which Hubbard participated for a while during 1945–46.

How is it amazing to find people who make their decisions or view the world based on it? It wasn&#8217;t too long ago that Christendom made many intersocial decisions based on the concept of Original Sin. The theta-MEST theory, if I am correct, is a fundamental pillar of the concept of one&#8217;s own godhood (source of and thus cause over MEST). Until one no longer needs to be god, one will look to confirm that one is, indeed, godlike.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire even depth-6 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329468"> 		<div id="comment-329468"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329468"> 				February 5, 2015 at 8:41 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329468#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329468", "329468", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Well said!

As science learns more and more about the nature of consciousness, such a duality seems less and less likely to capture the incredible nature of existence and consciousness.</p> <p>Scientologists in general are taught that dying is a causative act. You don&#8217;t die. You _drop_ your body. This is seen as not being a big deal. After all, you are an immortal being. And any grief felt by your survivors it is simply a secondary that can be handled as part of their own case. Therefore, dropping your body is not an overt against your first dynamic or other dynamics if you make an EOC decision for ethical reasons.</p> <p>Of course such details are never discussed or debated within Scientology because of the lack of free speech, the stifling of analytical reasoning, the absence of critical thought, and prohibitions against verbal tech.</p> <p>In a way, Scientology&#8217;s view of causatively dropping one&#8217;s body reminds me of the old MASH theme song: &#8220;Suicide is painless. It brings on many changes. And I can take or leave it if I please.&#8221;</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire even depth-6 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330304"> 		<div id="comment-330304"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330304"> 				February 18, 2015 at 7:28 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330304#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330304", "330304", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Good post FOTF.

The answer is no, not at all. Actually I haven&#8217;t really thought much about him since I left in 82. I think more about the people that have been harmed in his name after getting interested just recently.</p> <p>I stumbled on some blogs for fun just a few years ago and was quite curious about how things have developed.</p> <p>I have found, Marildi that I get various responses from people. I have been thanked very deeply and touched by people who have said that my thoughts have helped them.</p> <p>I have also been cursed and condemned by people as well. I take both responses as they come and understand them to be those people&#8217;s experience. What anyone thinks of me is their own business, not mine.</p> <p>My intention that has been stated before is twofold:</p> <p>1) Revisiting the 11 years of my development from the age of 18 to when I left the church. The revisiting allows me to go though my own mental files and discard any old unless thought forms that may be lingering. Things that I once thought were true, receded into my subconscious and became part of my energetic self so to speak: wrong knowledge</p> <p>2) The second purpose is to be an iconoclast to the false deceptive image that Ron causatively and deceptively perpetrated on our citizens.<br /> Specifically his third partying other paths, causing his students to only rely on him for guidance and trapping them in a prison of belief.<br /> Part of this second intention came about when the Indies were complaining about DM as the reason things are in a mess.<br /> With all my heart, I strongly disagree with this sentiment. </p> <p>I realized early on that people were having a hard time seeing Ron&#8217;s causative link to Scientology&#8217;s present condition. I knew that Scientologist&#8217;s have been conditioned to never be critical of Ron by way of threats to their family, jobs and continued being on the bridge.</p> <p>I then decided that I wanted to be a willing pinata and push as many buttons as I could, using reason and critical thinking, to help Indies be comfortable with criticism.</p> <p>So regarding step two, there is still much work to be done. I believe you and many others have no idea what a spell you have been under. Many people still think that only Ron knew the truth and there is no other path available for them. That is one thing I would love to address. Study others, learn from other wisemen and women. Ron was a dark soul. He was a confirmed liar and has harmed many people by third partying other spiritual paths.</p> <p>That is the essence of my constant criticism. To make it ok for those now out, to allow themselves to rehabilitate their own sovereign discriminating intelligence. And that starts with seeing L Ron Hubbard as he is, not the marketed lies of make believe he worked so hard to convince us of.</p> <p>So my question Marildi is: why does it bother you that I do?</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-8 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329805"> 		<div id="comment-329805"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/350d54331c090bcdace0f231815a0dd3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">marildi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329805"> 				February 8, 2015 at 2:04 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329805#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329805", "329805", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to marildi'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Okay, thanks. </p> <p>JMO, but you would probably be more successful if you were less heavy-handed in the way you go about it.

In general, I do my best to avoid having &#8220;beliefs&#8221;. </p> <p>What makes the most sense to me, up to now, is that Hubbard apparently considered scientology to be a gnostic faith &#8211;  which could explain the reason for all his &#8220;myths&#8221;. Per gnosticism, myths can embody basic truths. That could explain why some of the OT levels work for many people, regardless of whether or not they are literally true. </p> <p>Hubbard may also have considered himself to be what is called in gnosticism a &#8220;Messenger of Light&#8221;, whose purpose was to bring knowledge and freedom to others. I talked to an old-timer one time, back in the early &#8217;80&#8217;s, who knew Ron personally and told me that Ron was very excited when he realized what he was here to do. </p> <p>Be that as it may, it&#8217;s also possible that Hubbard was a false Messenger whose purpose was to deceive and entrap people by giving them some truths &#8211; along with untruths, with the actual aim of enslaving them. </p> <p>Whichever of the two purposes it was, it seems to me, based on my own study and experience, that he did reveal a lot of truth.

The most common confusion on the part of a preclear is between himself as an identified object and his beingness. One&#8217;s  beingness depends upon the amount of space which he can create or command, not upon his identification or any label. Identity as we know it in the MEST universe is much the same as identification, which is the lowest form of thought. When one is an object and is himself an effect, he believes that his ability to be cause is dependent upon his having a specific and finite identity. This is an aberration; as his beingness increases his individuality increases, and he quickly rises above the level of necessity for identity for he is himself self-sufficient with his own identity. </p> <p>The first question a preclear undergoing theta clearing asks himself is quite often: &#8220;How will I establish my identity if I have no body?&#8221; There are many remedies for this.<b> The worst method of having an identity is having a body.</b> As his individuality increases and his beingness expands &#8212; these two being almost synonymous &#8212; he is less and less concerned with this problem; that he is concerned with the problem tells the auditor where he is on the tone-scale . . . </p></blockquote> <p>. . . so speaketh Mainkind&#8217;s Greatest Friend. </p> <p>(As and aside, that first paragraph is kinda interesting when one considers just how tightly some people cling to the label &#8220;Scientologist&#8221; after escaping the cult.)</p> <p>Another aspect to bear in mind on Scientology&#8217;s disregard for the human body is that ubiquitous unofficial axiom &#8220;The Greatest Good for the Greatest Number of Dynamics&#8221;. This statement is bizarre when one considers that, assuming there is the slightest validity to &#8220;the dynamics&#8221;, each dynamic, starting with the second, is dependent for its survival on the one immediately below it. The first dynamic is the self operating in MEST world via the body. Providing that is surviving well, there develops an ability to put the second dynamic in place and, the healthier the second dynamic the more likely to survive is the third . . . and so on. That&#8217;s just logical, right? Well, in practise, Scientology demands that if a particular action will provide the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics, it is always the first &#8211; and pivotal &#8211; dynamic, the body, and then the second &#8211; family &#8211; which are sacrificed. </p> <p>Remember also that, as masters of the universe, Scientologists are &#8220;not their bodies&#8221;, Far from it. They are mighty spiritual beings dealing not with just one life time, but with millions and millions of life times stretching across the entirety of eternity. A billion year contract &#8211; yeah, sure, where do I sign?.  This sense of such vast scale, most often implanted by auditors leading people down the <strike>garden path</strike> whole-track  often results in an abnormally cavalier attitude about the physical matters of personal health and death.  </p> <p>Its been a while now since I first saw the video where David Miscavige and the rest of his capos announce the death of L Ron Hubbard to a hall full of Scientologists. Do you know what they did upon receiving the news that L Ron Hubbard had dropped his body? They rose as one to their feet in a prolonged celebratory ovation of cheering and clapping. Quite, quite bizarre.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-iamvalkov even depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330194"> 		<div id="comment-330194"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/742817c1603c6e5f9f5086f4763a57b5?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://valkovuddin.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>iamvalkov</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330194"> 				February 17, 2015 at 12:38 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330194#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330194", "330194", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to iamvalkov'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Cepuscule,  I recommend this,  for a more three dimensional understanding:<br /> <a href="http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/~dima/mytexts/suff.html#subjectivity" rel="nofollow">http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/~dima/mytexts/suff.html#subjectivity</a><br /> Also the concept of existentialist philosophy in general,  and the thought of Ken Wilbur,  as in &#8220;The Intergral Vision&#8221; or &#8220;A Brief History of Everything&#8221;..

Nikolai Berdyaev was an ardent Christian and his philosophical musings stand in direct opposition to what flimsy fragments of a philosophy the Lucifer-infused L Ron Hubbard was able to cobble together.</p> <p>I do understand that, rather than the body of his work, you were referring specifically to Berdyaev&#8217;s subjective/objective premise. I am not surprised to see it being raised because that subjective vs objective question is something of a constant theme in Scientology discussions when efforts are being made to defend the subject. The most common use of it that I have seen is in an effort to exclude anyone who has not personally undergone some form of Scientology processing. The idea being promoted is that without having experienced Scientology processing, a person is wholly unqualified to discuss it. Nothing could be further from the truth. For example, if such logic were to be valid, then there would be no male obstetricians. A more prosaic view highlights the abundantly apparent truth that your average wog understands more about Scientology then any Scientologist. Which is kinda ironic; for all L Ron Hubbards millions of words, the sum total of wog understanding of Scientology can be expressed in just one word: AVOID. </p> <p>In this specific raising of the subjective vs objective question, it would appear that the defense of Scientology is being shifted into the philosophical, rather than scientific, context. That&#8217;s quite understandable because anyone who believes  that L Ron Hubbard had anything useful to say about &#8220;the modern science of mental health&#8221; has an elephantine &#8220;MU&#8221; on the second and third words in that description. Science also requires that anything it states as fact can be objectively measured, something Scientology has never been able to do. Instead, it perpetually seeks to confuse anecdotal &#8220;success stories&#8221; with independently verifiable data. L Ron Hubbard also proved a third context for the defense of his fraud by drawing the cloak of religion over his operation. I&#8217;ve already addressed that aspect further down-thread so won&#8217;t labour the point here except to point out how tricksy it is to pin Scientologists and their enablers down. After all, depending on the argument being made, Scientology is an &#8220;applied philosophy&#8221;, and/or  an &#8220;exact science&#8221; and/or a &#8220;religion&#8221;, Shimmer Wax, comes to mind. </p> <p>So, here I am, after presenting a number of objective facts, being encouraged to read-up on Berdyaev&#8217;s subjective/objective premise in order to develop a &#8220;three dimensional understanding&#8221;. But, why would I want to limit my understanding of Scientology to just three dimensions and, even if I did, a three dimensional understanding of what, exactly?  The lethality of Scientology, the fundamental flaws of L Ron Hubbard&#8217;s &#8220;eight dynamics&#8221; which were being addressed in that exchange, or Scientology itself and, if so,  what use is the subjective/objective question in dealing with either or both of those? None, as far as I can see. I understand that for people locked into the Scientology prison of belief their subjective experiences trump objective reality every time. The very nature of Scientology processing starting with the entry level TRs  was carefully designed by L Ron Hubbard to ensure that very thing in order to encourage innocents to &#8220;clear&#8221;&#8221; their &#8220;banks&#8221; as quickly as possible. In Scientology&#8217;s case, </p> <p>Oddly enough, Berdyaev would agree with me and point to his concept of &#8220;Original Sin&#8221; whereby anthropocentrism and the confining of one&#8217;s thoughts to oneself leads to to self-imprisonment. L Ron Hubbard knew that too which is why Scientology is so solipsistic. I further agree with Berdyaev that the gaining of knowledge must rely in many respects on the seeker of knowledge making what is known a deep part of their being. Newton, for example, didn&#8217;t discover gravity at the moment when, as myth has it, an apple fell on his head.  Rather, Newton spent years and years learning up on extant &#8211; and objectively verifiable &#8211; knowledge, imbuing his very soul with what was objectively true so, when the apple dropped, it provided the lens through which the wider picture could be perceived. Inspiration, intuition, creativity, magic &#8211; call it what you will &#8211; but it didn&#8217;t happen with out a long and difficult runway cluttered up with all manner of subjective permutations. </p> <p>Where Berdyaev and I part ways is in his assertion that all knowledge is subjective when it originates. That&#8217;s like saying gravity didn&#8217;t exist until Newton discovered it and, at the moment when he did, gravity was his alone. That&#8217;s just silly. Its like saying &#8220;what&#8217;s true for you is what you have observed to be true&#8221;. It&#8217;s the doorway into the prison of belief where inhabitants are held captive in chains forged in the smelter of their own subjectivity. And that, my friend, is the labyrinth of the mind where time really is kept by the clapping of one hand. It is the obnosing of objective reality which sets us free and into the world where time is measured by three, or more, hands.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330369"> 		<div id="comment-330369"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/350d54331c090bcdace0f231815a0dd3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">marildi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330369"> 				February 19, 2015 at 11:30 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330369#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330369", "330369", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to marildi'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Crepuscule, what&#8217;s the problem with this statement you disagree with in 8-8008:</p> <p>&#8220;The worst method of having an identity is having a body.&#8221;</p> <p>Is it that you consider there are even worse methods of having an identity?

It was my first experience with auditing. It was quite successful but not without some difficulty.</p> <p>The earliest form of Dianetics in early 1950 was not that clean. It was corrupted by &#8220;continual auditor speculation&#8221; to guess at the engram and then run it as soon as one hit upon it. Read the auditing demos of that period from R&amp;D volumes. Hubbard is continually speculating on what the engram was, and then questioning the pc based on his speculation.</p> <p>This approach could only get the low hanging fruits, and beyond that it did not work because &#8220;occlusion&#8221; set in. The occlusion built up because Hubbard was not allowing the mind to &#8220;un-stack&#8221; itself. When there was nothing stacked up the engram simply appeared all by itself and could be run out. But Hubbard was always in extreme rush and did not have patrience for mind to unstack itself. The simplistic idea of chains had only limited value. The data in the mind is indexed in so many complex ways, that it is best to let the mind unstack itself in the order determined by it. That was the idea underlying the &#8216;file clerk&#8221; but Hubbard used the &#8216;file clerk&#8221; along with his continual speculations.</p> <p>Luckily, in my first auditing in 1969, the auditor let my &#8220;file clerk&#8221; have a free hand after instructing me to maintain TR0 during the sessions. Once I got the hang of it, many deep engrams appeared and were run out one after another during the latter period of 25 hours. What happened, surprised me a great deal, and there was immediate and perceptible benefit from it.</p> <p>So, undue influence in auditing was there even in the early 1950s due to Hubbard&#8217;s ineptitude. It somehow worked intermittently when right factors happen to came together.</p> <p>Mind-control came in with a flawed Theta-MEST theory that Hubbard treated like a &#8220;fourteen pound diamond.&#8221; He enforced that theory in all different ways possible. That gave him a way to make a person feel better by boosting his thetanic ego.<br /> .</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329202"> 		<div id="comment-329202"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62094ea8485520b990be9f9d0dd38dd2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">TheOracle</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329202"> 				February 3, 2015 at 11:57 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329202#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329202", "329202", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to TheOracle'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I think the post is addressing BELIEFS.  </p> <p>be·lief<br /> 1.an acceptance that a statement is true or that something exists.<br /> &#8220;his belief in the value of hard work&#8221;<br /> something one accepts as true or real; a firmly held opinion or conviction.<br /> opinion, view, conviction, judgment, thinking, way of thinking, idea, impression, theory, conclusion, notion a religious conviction.<br /> &#8220;Christian beliefs&#8221;<br /> synonyms:	ideology, principle, ethic, tenet, canon; More</p> <p>2. trust, faith, or confidence in someone or something.</p> <p>I do not think believing is the same as knowing.</p> <p>know<br /> : to have (information of some kind) in your mind</p> <p>: to understand (something) : to have a clear and complete idea of (something)</p> <p>: to have learned (something, as a skill or a language)</p> <p>a (1) :  to perceive directly :  have direct cognition of (2) :  to have understanding of  (3) :  to recognize the nature of :  discern<br /> b (1) :  to recognize as being the same as something previously known (2) :  to be acquainted or familiar with (3) :  to have experience of<br /> 2 a :  to be aware of the truth or factuality of :  be convinced or certain of<br /> b :  to have a practical understanding of </p> <p>What people believe and what they know, there can be a very wide space in between.</p> <p>I think it makes sense that Marty would know what the beliefs are.</p> <p>I would say myself, the culture that bubbled up around the conversations in that group,  made #7 a reality.

The hypnotic induction is an extended initial suggestion for using one&#8217;s imagination, and may contain further elaborations of the introduction. A hypnotic procedure is used to encourage and evaluate responses to suggestions. When using hypnosis, one person (the subject) is guided by another (the hypnotist) to respond to suggestions for changes in subjective experience, alterations in perception,[19][20] sensation,[21] emotion, thought or behavior.</p> <p>&#8220;Move to the beginning of the incident&#8230;&#8221;   This is a command.

I can see how this is a form of hypnotism.  And there has been much praise for hypnotic therapy.

And if they make a choice for them self, they are flattened with more force.</p> <p>That is complete hypnotism.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329652"> 		<div id="comment-329652"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ecd994d7f918147adaa53571480babdb?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Brian</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329652"> 				February 6, 2015 at 3:31 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329652#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329652", "329652", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Brian'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Oracle says,&#8221;Hubbard’s legacy has been destroyed by his own soldiers.&#8221;</p> <p>Hubbard&#8217;s legacy was and is destroyed by the instruction to be violent against critics.

As a magician, he was a magus opus. He broke a lot of spells.  He cast a lot of spells too. I don&#8217;t see eye to eye on some of the things he had to say about magic and magicians. But I did figure out the first law of magic myself.  And,it&#8217;s interesting because the first law magic means you can not share it.  What the first law is.  The first law of magic is, &#8220;Never tell&#8221;.   If you hold something back from the other person, you put them into &#8220;not know&#8221; when you know.  I think Hubbard&#8217;s obsession with with holds stems from this. He was obsessed in knowing that NOTHING was being with held from him.</p> <p>Contrary to his notions, with holds are NOT always preceded by overts.</p> <p>Do you share your hand at the poker table?  If you did,there wouldn&#8217;t be a game.</p> <p>Hubbard does give it up that inability to with hold can be a weakening point.</p> <p>What makes magic potent is purpose.

A lot of people do not want to be cause. And they do not want others to be cause. In fact, it is even considered evil or satanic.  You have to have a purpose to &#8220;be obedient&#8221; before you can be hypnotized. O.K.?   The therapy of Dianetics and Scientology can bring a person out of hypnotic state, but then you have culture enforcing total obedience and sec checking everyone to death out of FEAR of THEM!   Anyway, we are not the only people to be having these kinds of conversations.  The church of Scientology is not the first institution to claim the only way to salvation. And people do not have to explore Scientology to wake the f^*k up and think for themselves. personally have no urge to destroy Hubbard&#8217;s books or thoughts and I am not threatened by them. I also realize these ideas are not born from me and they are not mine. Some align with mine,and some have caused me to see things I did not see before, just like when I read any book by another human being. People do generally get very afraid of others who are willing to think for themselves, not just in the culture Scientology has become.</p> <p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oj3qS8OMeys?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire even depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329349"> 		<div id="comment-329349"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329349"> 				February 4, 2015 at 9:19 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329349#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329349", "329349", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>It is far more rational to look at &#8220;I&#8221; as a process with a structure.</p> <p>.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329343"> 		<div id="comment-329343"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329343"> 				February 4, 2015 at 8:25 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329343#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329343", "329343", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>The whole perception about HYPNOSIS changes, when one perceives SELF to be just a structure, and SELF-DETERMINISM to just be a mode of that structure.

I think the work Hubbard did up through OT2 was pretty simple and straight forward.  There is something to having lingering spiritual connections. For sure.  I think a person should be turned loose to work these things out for them self.  It&#8217;s hard promise to someone that you can hold their hand all the way into the supernatural. That they can be in command with those forces and conditions. Especially with a paramilitary group of soldiers on top of you in the environment. These are forces and condition in themselves that are not easy to manage.  If you took the Sea Org out of the picture, and the ethics officers, Scientology wouldn&#8217;t really be a strange thing to explore.  Most grown ups don&#8217;t want baby sitters and cops crawling all over them while they are straddled in parallel universes.  The whole Scientology universe has a cross purpose/identity conflict/out of valence issue. Hubbard changed the purpose,from clearing the planet to getting ethics in on the planet.  When he changed the purpose the whole dynamic shifted from spiritual to political.  To me, it&#8217;s the Sea Organization that makes it all strange and weird.  Not the Hubbard writings. Then Miscavige turning it into a religion?<br /> That kicked in a whole new chapter of case and fanatics. This is why it feels creepy.  It&#8217;s multivalent.  It&#8217;s not clear anymore as a group. It&#8217;s Identity.  Cross purposes. The soldiers got restless. They waited and waited and waited for the enemy to attack. Nobody paid any attention to them. For morale they began to stalk the perceived enemies. &#8220;Kill the psychs&#8221; blah blah.  Then they had some&#8221;squirrels&#8221; to go after from time to time.  The last ten years have been the glory of the Sea Org. Battle after battle.  No fight? They turned on each other.  Now they are famous mostly for domestic terrorism and domestic abuse. Piracy looting and pillaging.<br /> The closet hippies got left behind in the dust and put back on objectives to keep them busy while the wars are going on. They even have a &#8220;war chest&#8221;.   The purpose is domination, not liberation.  You see,that changing of purpose just flipped the whole thing around 180 degrees. And yes, Hubbard did that.  The place has cleared out because most people seeking to grow spiritually, do not want to be dominated and neither do they want to dominate others.  They want a hippie kind of harmony. ARC, understanding, a world of peace, pleasure, calm, laughter, love, education, joy,musicality.  The aesthetics of the supernatural.  Not soldiers stomping all over dead bodies. You can not dominate and liberate at the same time.  Hubbard locked the whole activity into a GPM.  He sabotaged it. And he did it on purpose.  This is what I find interesting.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-5 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329409"> 		<div id="comment-329409"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62094ea8485520b990be9f9d0dd38dd2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">TheOracle</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329409"> 				February 4, 2015 at 9:24 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329409#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329409", "329409", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to TheOracle'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>If you read KSW and a lot of other things he wrote around that time and after, it&#8217;s pretty clear he did not have a lot of arc for his peers.

You get your average guy who is going to stick it out. This can be for different reasons. Mine was curiosity. But in comes the person and struggles for 15 years at an expense of 300K to go home and talk to spirits in his living room. (Solonots) </p> <p>In the house next door you have a group of &#8220;wogs&#8221; with a Ouija Board and they are just doing it. You find people talking to angels,Gods, all sorts of communication going back between people and spirits. And it is a non issue and they have no C/S.  I was talking to spirits and animals when I was very young. I just got desperate for company and extended myself. I don&#8217;t know why Scientologists think it is so dangerous or unusual, and why they remain secretive about it.  They actually pretend that they are not doing it. And if you &#8220;let it out of bag&#8221; you have endangered everyone&#8217;s security.  It&#8217;s like,they are embarrassed about the &#8220;tech&#8221;.</p> <p>You go to Japan, those people for the most part feel their ancestors in their homes and honor them, even if they have been dead for hundreds of years.</p> <p>Why would anyone that has explored Scientology be offended to admit pop psychology or hypnotism?  There is an entire section in SOS called &#8220;hypnotic level&#8221;.  Hubbard pointed it out to people.  Scientologists I have noticed, generally have a problem admitting what they are doing and thinking.  And if they get busted, or get board, they  say they were &#8220;brainwashed&#8221;.  They do not want to admit they were hypnotized, they do not want to admit they took a walk on the wild side and dabbled in the occult.

The materials are free to everyone now. </p> <p>No, I do not need to attack Scientologists every where or the subject matter of Hubbard&#8217;s research and writings because of one terrorist organization.</p> <p>Time and time again the Sea Organization has proved themselves a threat to Scientologists and Scientology groups.

I personalIy do not view those things as pop psychology or hypnotism. In 35 years as an audiror, CS and Course Supe, I participated in countless wins and cognitions on all four flows.  And I think I have kept my gains after being out for almost 9 years now.  I still apply my wins and cogs in every day life.</p> <p>At the same time that LRH was developing/discovering what I very much value in the above, he was also a megolomaniac who was very slowly but surely going insane (by his own definitions) and establishing a Soviet syle fascistic organization bent on control of his parishioners&#8217; minds, behavoir and their money.  Some of LRH policy is wonderful, much of the Org Series for example and some of his early basic policies.  But the vast majority of it is his blueprint, procedures, and insane ideas which form the basis of the above mentioned Soviet style fascist organization.  There&#8217;s an amount of evil intention in it that is not pretty.  But to even stay IN Scientology, one had to agree that even the crazy things Ron said were &#8220;the truth.&#8221;  I still continue to have to this day (last night) &#8220;3D nightmares&#8221; about Scientology.</p> <p>If independant groups like the Dror people in Israel can audit and train people to more happiness, without using the 80% or so of LRH policiy that stinks, lies and hurts people, I say great for them.  Personally at 64, I no longer have any interest in or desire for any further Scientology training or processing.  I have moved on to other studies and activities which speak to me more now.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329376"> 		<div id="comment-329376"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/350d54331c090bcdace0f231815a0dd3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">marildi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329376"> 				February 4, 2015 at 3:01 pm</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks, Joe. I do mean the same as you do by &#8220;core scientology&#8221;, and I have also moved to other studies and activities. Doing so was validated by LRH himself back in 1951 in the Chart of Human Evaluation (SOS), where the highest tone level on the chart was characterized as “Search for different viewpoints in order to broaden own reality. Changes reality.&#8221;</p> <p>You probably remember the study tape “Training: Duplication” where LRH explains why it is that learning the truth about something is a road to having judgment – not only judgment in whatever subject is being studied, but judgment in general (even about women, he jokingly says in one part <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> ). I consider a gain in judgment to be one of the most – if not THE most &#8211; valuable things a person can take away from scientology. Here’s a quote from that 1962 study lecture:</p> <p>“Of course it’s [judgment] most rapidly restored on such a track by teaching the person the exact truth of something. There is the truth of something, he is able to duplicate the truth of something after many travails, and this truth of something is immediately pursued by the understanding of that something he has been taught. You understand that that is a stage; he’s still dependent on you for the understanding of what’s been taught. And your next stage up is a realization, which he reached at a sudden step up the line on his own bootstraps, so to speak. He regained an ability to understand, and so then he himself could realize. That’s the route that you’re taking. That route has total self-determinism and other-determinism and, of course, therefore, pan-determinism all mixed up in it, all at one fell swoop.</p> <p>“The person becomes pan-determined over the data. The person does not only understand why they learned the data but why the data was taught to them, and understand and REALIZE – of course, the realization includes the independent truth of the datum regardless of having been taught the datum. And with that, of course, a person has reached a high peak of the ability to judge something. A person then has judgment. There’s no other route that I know of. I mean if this is not a perfect route, all right, so it isn’t a perfect route. There is no perfect route.</p> <p>“Perhaps there is a perfect route, but there is no perfect route to hand at the moment if this is not a perfect route.”</p> <p>(&#8220;Training: Duplication&#8221;, 24 Jan 62)</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-9 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329291"> 		<div id="comment-329291"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62094ea8485520b990be9f9d0dd38dd2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">TheOracle</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329291"> 				February 3, 2015 at 7:41 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329291#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329291", "329291", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to TheOracle'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Have a look at this web site, and figure out how many false reports and how much false information, and wrong items the Organization is putting out there on a daily basis right now.

Have no idea what she was doing at Int as she never worked there while I was there. She was in ABLE Int in LA as the second in command (D/Executive Director ABLE International). When I was the WDC ABLE, I once sat in an all-day meeting with Laurie, Simon Hogarth (the ED ABLE Int at the time), the DSA ABLE Int, Lyman Spurlock (Corporate Coordinator CSI) and two church attorneys (Monique Yingling and Tim Bowles). Legally, the ABLE sector was not supposed to be sending money into the Sea Org reserve accounts, but it was, and the tax attorneys were trying to figure out a solution. I had made a proposal on how to organize the sector based on the attorney&#8217;s advice, which would have meant that the funds that had been going to Int Reserves would get rerouted to the social betterment programs themselves, instead. This didn&#8217;t fly with Miscavige, who said that it&#8217;s up to legal to find a way to set things up the way we (church management) want it, not the other way around. My proposal was therefore rejected and I was removed from post, restricted to the property and once again assigned to berthing out by the swamp. &#8221;</p> <p><a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/08/scientology_concentration_camp_the_hole.php" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/08/scientology_concentration_camp_the_hole.php</a></p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even depth-7 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329411"> 		<div id="comment-329411"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fc21e21e4ae412d49feac4779a9e0dcd?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://gravatar.com/palehorsey' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>palehorse</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329411"> 				February 4, 2015 at 9:42 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329411#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329411", "329411", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to palehorse'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I wonder how many Scientologists properly originated the cognition, &#8220;I can communicate about anything with anyone!&#8221; And I wonder how many of those Scientologists copped out of communicating by disconnecting instead.</p> <p>It is fascinating that these Born Again Communicators brandish Disconnection like a finely honed sword, thinking that they are &#8220;at cause over communication cycles.&#8221;</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire odd alt depth-8 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329461"> 		<div id="comment-329461"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329461"> 				February 5, 2015 at 7:33 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329461#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329461", "329461", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Good argument and excellent prose too! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even depth-8 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329501"> 		<div id="comment-329501"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62094ea8485520b990be9f9d0dd38dd2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">TheOracle</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329501"> 				February 5, 2015 at 1:06 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329501#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329501", "329501", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to TheOracle'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Great point palehorse.

And trust me. he,and his attorneys will rely upon people just like you in the court systems, that will buy into the idea that he has religious rights to follow his religion, and Hubbard is the one to blame because he founded Scientology.</p> <p>But I was there. I did not beat people, spy on people, abuse people, harm attack and suppress people. No matter what others were doing. I refused to take places in comm evs and I never disconnected from anybody, even when they were declared.  I have nothing to blame Hubbard for because I disregarded what didn&#8217;t feel right to me.</p> <p>And at this late date it is totally unlikely that I will contribute to a defense for David Miscavige. And hold someone else accountable for what he has done and is doing.</p> <p>Not that I don&#8217;t suspect witness&#8217;and arguments like you and yours, will provide a possible means for him to evade justice.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-9 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329916"> 		<div id="comment-329916"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0badc5640af149979f85ab7346205e34?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://gravatar.com/jumpingjack' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Jumping Jack</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329916"> 				February 9, 2015 at 1:56 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329916#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329916", "329916", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Jumping Jack'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>You are so literal, Oracle.

The preclear can be sent off by himself to yell. If a group is being processed where its noise will not disturb others, a back and forth interchange between the auditor and the group will be found beneficial. This process is very limited and has a tendency simply to make people cheerful [like it did in the posted video], but occasionally some cases are so inhibited on the making of noise that they are having difficulty with their vocal cords or with their mouths. Tooth trouble can be traced to the inhibition of making noise. Distaste for singing is equally traced to the making of noise.”</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330176"> 		<div id="comment-330176"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62094ea8485520b990be9f9d0dd38dd2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://gravatar.com/oraclemysticism' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>The Oracle</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330176"> 				February 16, 2015 at 12:32 pm</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGh0PLRxxc0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-iamvalkov even depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330200"> 		<div id="comment-330200"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/742817c1603c6e5f9f5086f4763a57b5?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://valkovuddin.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>iamvalkov</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330200"> 				February 17, 2015 at 2:15 am</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primal_therapy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primal_therapy</a></p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329209"> 		<div id="comment-329209"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329209"> 				February 3, 2015 at 12:05 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329209#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329209", "329209", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Maybe this belief needs to be explained better.

My criticism of this belief is as follows:</p> <p>1.	Scientology consists of much ground breaking work by Hubbard.</p> <p>2.	Scientology introduces a whole new plateau to addressing the problems of the mind.</p> <p>3.	The work on this breakthrough is, however, far from complete.</p> <p>4.	The success from the application of Scientology is far from consistent.</p> <p>5.	Any lack of success gets blamed on the practitioner of Scientology.</p> <p>6.	Unmanageable difficulties seem to exist in the application of Scientology.</p> <p>7.	Correction lists have become a part of “Standard Scientology.”</p> <p>8.	A closer look at Scientology shows a lack of application of the principle of poka-yoke.</p> <p>9.	Mindfulness is the key to successes in Scientology auditing.</p> <p>10.	Scientology does not seem to put emphasis on Mindfulness.</p> <p>11.	Scientology takes up aspects of mindfulness on TR0, Obnosis, and Data Series, but it fails to treat mindfulness systematically, and fails to highlight its importance in auditing.</p> <p>12.	The principles of Mindfulness were first elucidated by Buddha 2600 years ago.</p> <p>13.	Mindfulness seems to provide poka-yoke to Scientology processes.</p> <p>14.	The principles of Mindfulness are presented under KHTK Mindfulness on this blog.</p> <p>15.	Here is an example of application of mindfulness to Scientology processes – Running Scientology Grade 0 with Mindfulness (Part 1)</p> <p>16.

If the EP is intended to be &#8220;aa better meory&#8221;,  or &#8220;Higher IQ&#8221;,  if it does that, then that&#8217;s it.

My grandfather didn&#8217;t approve of comic books or sci-fi,  because they were not reality oriented.   He was kinda suppressive in that way.   He didn&#8217;t see the value of fantasy or even imagination unless they were placed in service of &#8220;reality&#8221;.   In fact I kinda agree that &#8220;agreement with reality&#8221; is not a very worthy goal,  especially when it is enforced.  As when cops beat people up for not mindlessly complying with their  their commands.   Obviously it is the cops&#8217; reality ythat their commands must be obeyed,  or else.   What kind of freedom is that?  Makes me wonder about some of the statements posted by commenters here,  who appear to be trying to enforce their view of Hubbard on everyone else.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire odd alt depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330205"> 		<div id="comment-330205"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330205"> 				February 17, 2015 at 8:01 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330205#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330205", "330205", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Valkov, good to see you back.

This relates to ontology, which is the study being, reality, etc. Some thoughts.</p> <p>In terms of ontology I myself fall in the range of constructivist and post positivist.</p> <p>Constructivism holds that what we consider reality Is constructed by ourselves. To me this is nearly self-evident as it relates to things like beliefs, religion, culture, and so forth. This can be correlated to be subjective reality whether within an individual or a group.</p> <p>Positivism holds that there is a universe independent of human considerations and that the truths of the universe can be determined. Post positivism makes a qualification. It asserts that we can get closer and closer to understanding the universe, but most likely we can never get there 100%. Positivism and post positivism correlate to objective reality.</p> <p>While Scientology as a constructed, subjective reality and culture Is pretty much immune from having to prove itself (like religion in general), it makes a number of objective claims that do not stand up to scrutiny and which can be and have been falsified, and/or for which no objective evidence has been brought forward.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329253"> 		<div id="comment-329253"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/87e14f750c932bc3c4ac9adccf42ebfd?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='https://plus.google.com/105599518456815048425' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Gene Trujillo</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329253"> 				February 3, 2015 at 3:17 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329253#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329253", "329253", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Gene Trujillo'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hubbard tricked CofSers into using hypnotic, domination techniques.

There were some powerful magicians. I think Jesus was one of them. Don&#8217;t you believe in magic?  Isn&#8217;t magic part of the Scientology belief system also?<br /> Not sure why you fundamentalists always discount it.</p> <p>“But mysticism/occultism isn’t our source. Our source, actually, is magic. Magic is something that, today, is performed on a stage with prestidigitation. But magic actually has a much more vivid and noble history than a stage magician. It is quite remarkable that the magician attempts directly to use spirits to perform his will. And that is his basic modus operandi. That is his goal in practicing magic.”from a Lecture given on 29 January 1958, The History of Clearing by L Ron Hubbard.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329530"> 		<div id="comment-329530"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a1049d2528a46f6bd92dca4577fd768f?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://www.unicef.org/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Cat Daddy</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329530"> 				February 5, 2015 at 4:01 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329530#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329530", "329530", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Cat Daddy'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Magic is just mindgames</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-5 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329571"> 		<div id="comment-329571"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62094ea8485520b990be9f9d0dd38dd2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">TheOracle</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329571"> 				February 5, 2015 at 9:32 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329571#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329571", "329571", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to TheOracle'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>See how you just made nothing out of something?

I remember a yound Marc Valliers from my days on Flagship during the 70&#8217;s.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t know if Scientology dogma advocates death, but it does discount individual life in favor of the survival of the Church of Scientology. I regrad the following beliefs in Scientology to be false.</p> <p>(1) A soul (thetan) is believed to exist indpendent of the body, and even to move to another body after the death of a previous body. This is not the belief in Buddhism or in other Eastern religions, which differentiate spiritual elements from soul. A soul is a configuration of spiritual elements. This configuration is temporary and it disintegrates after death. The spiritual elements may continue like the physical elements (atoms and molecules), but not a particular configuration as a body or a soul.</p> <p>(2) That LRH continues to exists as a being is a false belief. His soul is disintegrated just like his body. The concept of &#8220;reincarnation&#8221;  is misunderstood in the western society. It is no a being that gets reborn. It is simply a new configuration of spiritual and physical elements. It is not only a new body, but also a new soul. The spiritual elements that made up Hubbard&#8217;s soul may continue like the physical elements that made up up his body. But they are long absorbed in new bodies and souls.</p> <p>Scientology has simply exploited the ignorance of western cultures in these matters.<br /> .</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329245"> 		<div id="comment-329245"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/350d54331c090bcdace0f231815a0dd3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">marildi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329245"> 				February 3, 2015 at 2:40 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329245#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329245", "329245", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to marildi'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Then why did Buddha say he recalled many of his own past lives, and that he had been &#8220;born for the last time&#8221;?</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire even depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329250"> 		<div id="comment-329250"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329250"> 				February 3, 2015 at 3:09 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329250#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329250", "329250", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>In my understanding, Buddha was talking about different configurations of spiritual elements that he was aware of.

The monk Sati tried to corner the Buddha when he asked about the soul.  The Buddha replied  that he never taught that doctrine.  In ancient India, the Vedas had inspired the doctrine of<br /> transmigration.  The Buddha was breaking from that tradition.  His idea of<br /> &#8220;no self&#8221; or no soul was new.  This is not correctly reported in Scientology so it is important.  In another meeting, the Buddha when pressed about the soul and was silent.  This gets back to the idea of the working construct of the idea of &#8220;no self&#8221;.  The Buddha was very clear that theoretical issues were to be avoided as no one could prove the existence of the soul.  At the mundane level of awareness, the soul is evident as an awareness because of the grasping better called in this case &#8220;bhava kamma&#8221;.  This is an aspect of kamma restrcted to the idea of the soul.  The Buddha was also clear in the doctrine that the universe, in his view, had no beginning.  This contradicts Scientology&#8217;s &#8220;Before the beginning was a cause&#8221;.  At the surpramundane level in early Buddhism, the idea of soul is examined in a four fold void corresponding to the Noble Truths.  The Buddha clearly stated that he had to do this.  In phenomenological reality the working constucts of soul and &#8220;no self&#8221; are used to see multiple causes or Karma with a capital K.  Thus Buddha instructed us to keep away from theoretical discussions of the soul.<br /> The structure of the universe in Original Buddhism is vast and complex,<br /> but centered on one point which is not a soul.<br />   Axiom 25 would not apply.  Co-existence of static violates the primary dictum of Buddhism.  Everything is impermanent.  Existence or co-existence is &#8220;bhava kamma&#8221;.  This is a hinderance to knowledge.<br />    The Chart of Atitudes also does not apply.  The Buddha does not use MEST in the same way as Hubbard.  The Buddha clearly stated that the elements of the universe are physical atoms and mind.  Mind is not a spirit, soul or theta.<br /> It is dependent on matter for awareness. This is complex stuff better left for now.<br />    A better topic to discuss is Meta or loving-kindness.  This operates on a far higher plane than affinity.<br />     At any rate, the primary point is that &#8220;no self&#8221; is a working construct used<br /> in meditation.  Thetans in Buddhisms are impermanent gods subject to the laws of kamma.  These gods come in many flavors.</p> <p>GMW</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-7 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330039"> 		<div id="comment-330039"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/350d54331c090bcdace0f231815a0dd3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">marildi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330039"> 				February 11, 2015 at 10:10 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330039#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330039", "330039", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to marildi'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>G, thanks very much for your learned comments. Very helpful. Buddha&#8217;s idea of &#8220;no self&#8221; as a working construct makes more sense, put in that way.  </p> <p>You also wrote: &#8220;The structure of the universe in Original Buddhism is vast and complex, but centered on one point which is not a soul.&#8221;</p> <p>Is that one point karma (with or without the capital &#8220;K&#8221;)? </p> <p>I get a sense of what is meant by karma as being a sort of inevitable flow of things, and that makes sense to me too.

This<br /> sounds contradictory because there is &#8220;no self.&#8221;  The contradiction is<br /> handled because the point of self/no self is an inflection point.  The<br /> forces of karma are manifested in a series of mental contaminations.  The Buddha used a word which translates as &#8220;fermentations&#8221; or &#8220;pickled&#8221;.<br /> Imagine a person soaked in Bud Light.  The brain is in fermentation.  This is the analogy on the level of thought.  Free will is not possible when picked.Since the<br /> goal is cessation, free will is really the idea of stillness.  You do not have the idea of free will in the modern sense of capitalism in Buddhism.  Gain/loss are lower levels.<br />     The centered point is not Karma with a capital &#8220;K&#8221;.  Buddha uses the idea of<br /> the &#8220;centered point&#8221; to get the idea that &#8220;all you need for salvation is within your five or six foot body&#8221;.  You don&#8217;t need anything else. Time in original Buddhism is not linear.  Thus you cannot apply the idea of MEST.  There is no beginning in Buddhism.  Also, the past and the future are infinite.  However, you can center yourself in the universe through meditation.  It sounds strange.  But remember Time is non-linear.<br /> The individual thus has an input of both determinism and free will at the same time.  Free will in Buddhism is better defined as the removal of black karma.<br /> Karma with a capital &#8220;K&#8221; is the grand accountant of the universe.  It is<br /> like a debit and credit card that does not go away.<br />    The &#8220;who&#8221; or &#8220;what&#8221; is impermanent and temporary.  The being comes from nowhere and goes nowhere.  There is no &#8220;doer&#8221; in Buddhism.<br />     You can look at all of Buddhism as birth/existence/death.  Buddha taught this  as a fundamental building block.  Hubbard&#8217;s create, create, create would<br /> have been rejected as temporary.  The cosmic cycle in Buddhism extends over more than 91 big bangs but there is no end.  Buddha said it went on and on beyond.  Moral Thetans are accounted for in Buddhism.  They actually hang around in a special place waiting for the next big bang.  They never go clear until Nirvana or Nibbana.  They are impermanent.<br /> GMW</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire odd alt depth-9 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330101"> 		<div id="comment-330101"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330101"> 				February 13, 2015 at 7:33 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330101#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330101", "330101", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I love your explanation.<br /> .</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-99whitegm even depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330117"> 		<div id="comment-330117"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b38557e51e256dac2907a7dd1f51e808?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://gravatar.com/99whitegm' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Path of Buddha</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330117"> 				February 14, 2015 at 8:25 am</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>vinaire,<br />    Thanks.

One reference that comes to mind is a short paragraph from 8-8008, which describes a state above 40.0, the highest level on the tone scale: </p> <p>&#8220;Space is not necessary to the beingness of a thetan when the thetan is above the tone level of 40.0 and can create space at will.

BEINGNESS CAN EXIST WITHOUT ANY ENERGY OR MATTER, WHICH IS TO SAY, WITHOUT TIME [my caps].</p> <p>Another part of Hubbard&#8217;s cosmology would be the Gradient Scale of Exteriorization (COHA). At the top of the scale is &#8220;a true Static&#8221; &#8211; that might correspond to the description of Nirvana as &#8220;stillness&#8221;. Here it is:</p> <p>“There is a gradient scale of exteriorization which could be described as follows:<br /> &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br /> First, the thetan without contact with a universe;<br /> Then, a thetan in full contact with a universe;<br /> Then, a thetan in contact with part of a universe, who considers the remainder of the universe barred to him;<br /> Then, a thetan in a universe without any contact with any part of the universe;<br /> Then, a thetan unknowingly in contact with a large part of a universe.<br /> &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p> <p>“The first condition would be a true Static. The last condition is called, colloquially, in Scientology, ‘buttered all over the universe.’</p> <p>“As it is with a universe, such as the physical universe, so it is with physical bodies. The thetan, who has already gone through the cycle on the universe itself, may be in contact with a physical body in the same order:</p> <p>&#8220;At first he would be without association with a physical body;<br /> Then, with occasional contact with bodies;<br /> Then, with a fixed contact on one body but exteriorized;<br /> Then, interiorized into a body but easy to exteriorize;<br /> Then, in contact with and interiorized into a body, but withdrawn from the various parts of the body;<br /> Then, obsessively ‘buttered all through the body’;<br /> Then, obsessively and unknowingly drawn down to some small portion of the body, and so forth.</p> <p>“This is the gradient scale which includes inversion and then inversion of the inversion. The auditor will discover preclears are very variable in the matter of exteriorization. Some preclears, even when they have a dark field, exteriorize rather easily. Others, after a great deal of work, are still found to be difficult to exteriorize. The matter of exteriorization is the matter of which level of inversion the preclear is in.</p> <p>“One of the more difficult levels to work is so inverted that he thinks that a thetan is running him. In other words, here is a thetan functioning in a body and actually running it through various covert communication lines, who yet believes he is a body to such an extent that he considers himself, or any life around him to be some other being&#8230;&#8221;</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330116"> 		<div id="comment-330116"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b38557e51e256dac2907a7dd1f51e808?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://gravatar.com/99whitegm' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Path of Buddha</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330116"> 				February 14, 2015 at 8:22 am</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hi M,<br />     Great response.   I&#8217;m happy you laughed at &#8220;pickled.&#8221; The critical issues boil down to the definition of a body and &#8220;potential&#8221;.<br />      Exteriorization from the body is a step beyond mindfulness which does not apply to Buddhism.  In Scientology, Hubbard talks about the body as an<br /> object.  He does this over and over.  In the scripture that you posted above,<br /> it is a central theme.  Hubbard uses the idea of the &#8220;genetic entity&#8221; as the conductor of the body.  This body is used in transmigration.  This theory fails at the outset because it ends in the dichotomy  of theta and mest.  In original Buddhism the body is a product of physical matter and Karma with a capital &#8220;K&#8221;.  The internal world and the external world are linked together into a unified whole with mind.  The difference in regard to the thetan is related to Hubbard&#8217;s &#8220;potential&#8221;  In other words, the thetan  has the ability to return or transmigrate.  In Buddhism, nibbana or cessation is bliss and it is not necessary to return.<br /> It is &#8220;letting go&#8221;.  Hubbard wanted to keep grasping or clinging in the picture.<br /> You can come up with any scale you want 40.0 or 400.0, you are still stuck in the Max Planck constant.  You could also call it Hubbard&#8217;s paradox.</p> <p>“As it is with a universe, such as the physical universe, so it is with physical bodies. The thetan, who has already gone through the cycle on the universe itself, may be in contact with a physical body in the same order:&#8221;</p> <p>The above merits discussion.<br />     Hubbard separates the universe from the thetan and implies that they go through the same cycle.  In Buddhism, there is an integerated view.  Mind and matter exist.  The idea of the thetan is derived.  It is not primary.  There is<br /> no description of nirvana which includes anything like a thetan or potential.<br /> Think of Buddha&#8217;s definition as a live shell you would find on the beach.<br /> A child not knowing about these animals knows there is something inside but<br /> cannot describe it.  Hubbard does not know what the universe is, but describes it with the thetan.  In reality, what is in the shell and how it was formed is far more complex.  The thetan would be the child drawing conclusions with no understanding.</p> <p>“Space is not necessary to the beingness of a thetan when the thetan is above the tone level of 40.0 and can create space at will. He creates space to have specific beingness. AT 40.0 space and beingness can be considered to be interchangeable. BEINGNESS CAN EXIST WITHOUT ANY ENERGY OR MATTER, WHICH IS TO SAY, WITHOUT TIME [my caps].</p> <p>In Physics, it is not proven that  beingness can exist without time.<br /> What Hubbard is talking about here is theoretical.  There is no experiment that proves this.  You could use quantum physics.  However most of these experiments were done in the 1930&#8217;s and Hubbard does not define them.<br /> They are not proven.  The observer is not defined in science.<br />   If a person wants to accept Hubbard on faith, that is clearly an option.<br /> Beingness without time is a derivative of the exteriorization of the thetan<br /> which is also not proven.  We are into some wild speculation which is beyond science.  These axioms you quote are not convincing.<br />     In Buddhism, it is not important if beingness is &#8220;in time&#8221; or &#8220;out of time&#8221;<br /> The process is more important.  </p> <p>May all pickled beings be well and happy!</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330160"> 		<div id="comment-330160"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/350d54331c090bcdace0f231815a0dd3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">marildi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330160"> 				February 15, 2015 at 6:46 pm</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hi G,</p> <p>&#8220;May all pickled beings be well and happy!&#8221; You got a hearty lol on that one. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-bigsmile' title=':D'>:D</span></p> <p>G: &#8220;Beingness without time is a derivative of the exteriorization of the thetan which is also not proven.&#8221;</p> <p>As a matter of fact, there is a lot of scientific evidence of exteriorization (easily found on the internet) in spite of the fact that scientists in general and thus the media (especially in this country) don&#8217;t pay it much heed.

Campbell is a NASA physicist and a researcher of “consciousness” for several decades. As a scientist, he used scientific protocol in experiments involving his and others&#8217; OOB experiences. He and a research partner named Dennis Mennerich started out being skeptical (but open-minded), as any good scientist would be. They had quite a moment when they got the first proof that their OOB experiences were real. Below is an excerpt from Campbell&#8217;s book *My Big TOE*.</p> <p>—————————<br /> “One of our first experiments was for Dennis and me to take a trip (experience) in the nonphysical together. Our independent descriptions of what we were experiencing should correlate closely if the experience were real and independent of either of us. From the beginning of our training, we had learned to give real-time descriptions of whatever we experienced. A microphone was suspended from the ceiling above each of our heads. What we said was recorded on tape. Dennis and I could not hear each other because we were in separate soundproof chambers.</p> <p>“Dennis and I quickly achieved the appropriate altered state, left our bodies, and met in the nonphysical as planned. It was a long adventure. We went places, saw things, had conversations with each other and with several nonphysical beings we happened to run into along the way.</p> <p>“Bob had let us go a long time before he ended the session and called us back. We pulled off our EEG and GSR electrodes and stumbled out of the darkness into the hallway of the lab.</p> <p>“In the control room, Bob was waiting for us. After a quick exchange, we knew that this would be a good test because we both had experienced many specific interactions. But were they the same interactions? Bob looked at us deadpan. ‘So you two think you were together?’ he asked, trying to sound disappointed. We looked at each other and shrugged our shoulders.</p> <p>“‘Maybe,’ Dennis said tentatively, ‘at least we perceived meeting each other.’</p> <p>“‘Listen to this!’ Bob said emphatically. The tapes, rewound as we disconnected electrodes and climbed out of our chambers, began to roll forward. We sat down and listened. The correlation was astonishing. For almost two hours we sat there with our mouths open, hooting and exclaiming, filling in the details for each other. Bob was now grinning. ‘Now that tells you something, doesn’t it?’ he exclaimed beaming. He was every bit as excited as we were.</p> <p>“I was dumbfounded. There was only one good explanation: THIS STUFF WAS REAL! […]</p> <p>We repeated that experiment with similar results. It wasn’t a phenomenon that depended on the two of us. Nancy Lea and I shared equally astonishing joint experiences. We tried other things as well. We read three and four digit numbers written on a blackboard next to the control room. Somebody would write a random number and we would read it while our bodies lay asleep. Then they would erase it and write another one, and so on and on. We went places – to people’s homes – and saw what they were doing, then called them or talked to them the next day to check it out…” </p> <p>(Thomas Campbell – *My Big TOE*)<br /> —————————-</p> <p>Here’s the link, if you want to continue reading where the above leaves off (the whole book can be read for free on Google books):</p> <p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=RYHtBPiZVgsC&#038;pg=PA84&#038;dq=%22trip+%28experience%29+in+the+nonphysical+together%22&#038;hl=en&#038;ei=750HTtqMKsvEswbvp9TbDA&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=book_result&#038;ct=result&#038;resnum=1&#038;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&#038;q=%22trip%20(experience)%20in%20the%20nonphysical%20together%22&#038;f=false" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=RYHtBPiZVgsC&#038;pg=PA84&#038;dq=%22trip+%28experience%29+in+the+nonphysical+together%22&#038;hl=en&#038;ei=750HTtqMKsvEswbvp9TbDA&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=book_result&#038;ct=result&#038;resnum=1&#038;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&#038;q=%22trip%20(experience)%20in%20the%20nonphysical%20together%22&#038;f=false</a></p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330162"> 		<div id="comment-330162"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/350d54331c090bcdace0f231815a0dd3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">marildi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330162"> 				February 15, 2015 at 7:04 pm</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>p.s.

Here is a book that reflects some American attitudes.  It is a largely unexamined subject,  compared to some other cultures.   Look at the traditional Japaness attitudes towards death and suicide in particular.  That was a culture in which suicide was actually institutionalized and called for under some circumstances.    What I am saying is,  a culture&#8217;s attitiudes towards death and suicide in particular,  usually constitute a &#8220;bubble&#8221; of its own,  apart from any &#8220;objective&#8221; reality of death.  I don&#8217;t think we know much about what happens,  and this makes us susceptible to &#8220;stories&#8221; about it.    Early Christians were notoriously fearless of death,  as are today&#8217;s &#8220;Islamic&#8221; suicide bombers.    They were disliked by secular rulers then,  and are just as disliked by today&#8217;s powers-that-be,  because not fearing death, they are difficult or impossible to control.   Even in recent history,  was it not Patrick Henry who said &#8220;Give me Liberty, or give me death!&#8221; ?<br /> Hubbard did write a funeral service that I liked,  because it validates the idea that the person is not entirely &#8220;dead and gone&#8221; but has moved on into the future.   Its a comforting thought.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-iamvalkov even depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330230"> 		<div id="comment-330230"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/742817c1603c6e5f9f5086f4763a57b5?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://valkovuddin.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>iamvalkov</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330230"> 				February 17, 2015 at 4:12 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330230#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330230", "330230", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to iamvalkov'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Forgot to post the link about the book:<br /> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Way_of_Death" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Way_of_Death</a></p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330282"> 		<div id="comment-330282"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/350d54331c090bcdace0f231815a0dd3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">marildi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330282"> 				February 17, 2015 at 11:44 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330282#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330282", "330282", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to marildi'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Nice post.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329211"> 		<div id="comment-329211"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bc76c70f1d36bab883b25e61124cad27?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">OT Umpty Ump</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329211"> 				February 3, 2015 at 12:18 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329211#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329211", "329211", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to OT Umpty Ump'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Done it all&#8230; I have found the above to be true, except for Xenu and the gang.

So, there was an earlier time here, an earlier beginning. But the point is, there were Earth people, even if the Xenu incident happened. Earth was not an abandoned planet.<br /> So, the Earth people would not have been part of that. Doesn&#8217;t anyone ever think about that?  So why would they need to think that applied to them if they did get involved with Scientology?  And Hubbard made a lot of snarkey comments about Earth.  The people who were already here were not dumped here and were nobodies prisoners. The &#8220;loyal officers&#8221; and all the rest that got offloaded, don&#8217;t even act like guests.

As a Libertarian I respect your religious beliefs and your right to speak freely of them. I also respect the rights of others to speak freely about anything they wish to comment on. Yeah, things get messy when free speech is practiced, but freedom by its very nature is messy. If one values freedom, one has to learn to tolerate all that freedom others are exercising too. Or one could just live in a neat and tidy tyranny if that is what they prefer. Having said all that, I would like to say this about the standard tech you mentioned. I got into Scientology via DMSMH back in the 70s. That book promised eidetic memory when Clear was reached.  It also promised alleviation from all psychosomatic ills. After 30 years  of &#8220;standard tech&#8221; I never even came close to eidetic memory.  And I have the same psychosomatic illnesses I was hoping to deal with back in the 70s.  When you say people are &#8220;winning&#8221; with standard tech, that is just too vague for me. I had specific, clear-cut gains I was going for based on promises from Hubbard, yet these were never forthcoming despite lots and lots and lots and lots of auditing (through the OT levels by the way), including tons of repairs, O/W pulling, PTS handlings etc etc etc. Sure, I had &#8220;wins&#8221; all the time whereby I was temporarily elated.

Perhaps I would add that for the vast majority of those still in and many who are out, that the &#8220;game&#8221; of Scn. is having these &#8220;mysteries&#8221; revealed to one as they progress.</p> <p>1. The &#8220;Prison Earth&#8221; idea is expressed in one&#8217;s training as early as the first auditor course one does. It is strongly bookend-ed by information on the ARC=U, session procedures, etc., &#8211; but it is still an indoctrination item regards what things are wrong with a person.<br /> 2. Xenu never comes up until one is well into their progress into higher levels and training. However, those that &#8220;know&#8221; are well-trained to generally keep their mouth shut and present themselves as &#8220;knowing the mystery&#8221; below what is wrong with who they are talking to. I&#8217;ve heard this expressed as an ingenious trap, and the fact of hearing this and such statements in conversations with the intiated leave one feeling that there is something to know and drives one to the goal. So, again, another indoctrination to continuing up to discover the mystery.<br /> 3. &#8220;Psychs&#8221; being the root of all evil is heavily promoted and a firmly held belief, and a strongly run indoctrinational point very quickly for those who are new to the subject.<br /> 4. Hubbard&#8217;s &#8220;discovery&#8221; of the mysteries, and development of the only technology to walk through the construct is another strong indoctrination in his &#8220;Keeping Scientology Working&#8221; writings. Reinforced each time a new development is announced, in most technical writings on the subject, and so on.<br /> 5. &#8220;Behaving as Ron&#8221;, the most blatant example of this indoctrination is how he recommends handling a post in an organization or otherwise. &#8220;What would Ron do?&#8221;<br /> 6. &#8220;Enemies&#8221; are firmly established by his writings, but most specifically covered in his &#8220;Conditions Formulas&#8221; works and the Suppressive Persons, Potential Trouble Source writings. To the latter, again, a fairly early piece of church indoctrination.<br /> 7. The technology itself, I am personally only beginning to see the hypnotic aspects of it, although I do have some reality on the &#8220;pop psychology&#8221; reference. In short, what I have presently come to understand is that the whole &#8220;present time&#8221; aspects are possibly the most theraputic aspects of anything Hubbard wrote, which I have also found are expressed countless times in many self-help and religious works, as well as sport and artistic fields. &#8220;Being in the moment&#8221;, &#8220;being in the zone&#8221;, etc. Sitting down and interiorizing on past upsets, transgressions, etc. to then change one&#8217;s mind about them to then &#8220;come to present time&#8221;, from an outsider point of view, seems a long way around the mulberry bush to simply just handling the present environment as it is. Lots of time was wasted by me to find irrelevant root causes to things I should and could simply handle in the now. Ultimately I find life taught me a much better lesson than Hubbard could, and to that, I am much more fulfilled as a result. However, I begin to really feel for those who lost or weaked their abilities to simply just have their full attention on their environment at will, and those that bought the promise that auditing will restore it. Each time they buy, is another step to &#8220;resolving the ultimate mystery&#8221;.<br /> 8. Unfortunately this is so true as a working practice, I am hard pressed to argue about this not being a &#8220;belief&#8221;. In my own area, I have seen suicides, persons who are to a significant degree &#8220;undersireable&#8221; or not qualified to access higher levels of the Promise of Scn. due to their physical being, sexual orientation, or even age. &#8220;They need to drop their body&#8221; is a common refrain. Ultimately, were I pressed to determine why this was so common in my own area, I would have to identify those factors in the works of Hubbard and how he desired public indoctrinated. Hence, yes, a belief and faith in what he wrote being the only answer to the problems noted above.</p> <p>Not a pretty nor politically correct distillation of the core of Scientology, but personally resonating and true, none-the-less.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire even depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329351"> 		<div id="comment-329351"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329351"> 				February 4, 2015 at 9:57 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329351#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329351", "329351", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hubbard was intetriorized into &#8220;I&#8221;, and Scientology is an expression of that.

I was not aware of spiritual interference. The whole space opera story I really didn&#8217;t attach much interest or significance to.  It was the idea of extending further into the supernatural that interested me.</p> <p>To be able to step into the invisible and be at home in that space. </p> <p>When I took a look there were a lot of interesting things to see. Can&#8217;t say I have ever thought of &#8220;BT&#8217;s&#8221; although I have used the word for the benefit of communicating to an auditor.  They were not part of my body, they were part of my soul. There were people that were part of my soul. A lot of them, in a better place than I was. I didn&#8217;t feel any need to distance myself from that, I mean,it just didn&#8217;t bother me.  Some were there because of unfinished conversations. Most were there because of the laws of ARC, and occupying the same space for that reason. Some were just earlier versions of me, that I parked in a closet. Per the laws of ARC you know, you occupy the same space through affinity. Not through engrams.  That is what was true for me. But if you loved someone, and you were pushed off a cliff together,and you were both killed, do you think that could really create distance between you?</p> <p>Yes,it is sometimes noisy in your space when you can hear one another&#8217;s thoughts. That noise comforts me. I have learned a lot from these conversations. A lot of valuable information.</p> <p>Hubbard said magicians use spirits to do their bidding, as a goal.  I can see how he thought that, but it is not a goal for everyone involved in magic. I don&#8217;t do that myself.</p> <p>You find many people on Earth that say they are doing &#8220;God&#8217;s&#8221; bidding.</p> <p>I feel there many Gods. And I care to remain in favor with them.</p> <p>The here and now is not very relevant to me. I have someplace I am going to be,in the future.  And where I am going to be about 1,000 years from now, is important to me.</p> <p>I am just gathering an education.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire odd alt depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329934"> 		<div id="comment-329934"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329934"> 				February 9, 2015 at 4:54 pm</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>If the word &#8220;BT&#8221; is replaced by the word &#8220;inconsistency&#8221; one will get better results on upper OT Level.

See, it wasn&#8217;t so ill intended as you thought.</p> <p>Any looking is better than no looking. Being attuned to and being cognitive of the inner world of limitless imaginings and states of being, the endless filters of mind that color our true nature as raw power, light and being is truly a hero&#8217;s journey indeed. As Joseph Campbell has stated,&#8221;Some mystics drown in the mystery and some become good swimmers&#8221; (paraphrase)</p> <p>So for you the OT 3 materials were a metaphor or a good excuse to go diving inwards and look?</p> <p>If I&#8217;m getting you correctly, OT3 materials are not literal. Xenu was simply an idea of Hubbard&#8217;s from his Sci Fi imagination? And 75,000,000 years ago, just his imagination.</p> <p>Do you believe Hubbard believed it? And in your opinion, could running this level and assigning cause to one&#8217;s problems on this level create distortions in one&#8217;s capacity to directly perceive truth? If in fact what is being run is not true.</p> <p>That is, if our problems are not our own, but something outside of ourselves, or more exactly, some alien creature attached to us.</p> <p>Can you see that this approach can be the cause of mental delusions for some?

It is like you are insisting that the question, &#8220;Do you still beat your wife?&#8221; be answered with a yes or a no.</p> <p>Xenu and BTs seems to provide a certain framework for auditing at OT3. It is not the belief in this framework that produces actual auditing results. But some people literally start to believe in that framework and lose their rationality. </p> <p>This may not happen with everybody though. Some may not believe in the framework of Xenu and BTs, but may just find that there are some auditing results.</p> <p>What produces actual auditing results (without the hypnotic &#8220;feel good&#8221; effect) is mindfulness. There is this factor of mindfulness in scientology auditing, but it occurs very infrequently right in the geginning of one&#8217;s auditing, or never at all.</p> <p>Personally, using the framework of Xenu and BTs is completely unnecessary. It is a product of convoluted mind of Hubbard. Straight application of the Scientific Method with mindfulness is much more effective.

She offered to audit me, which was a rather soothing balm as I went through what essentially was my withdrawal period. Though I never took her up on the offer, just the fact of knowing that helped me dramatically, I think. My point was mainly that I found she served a worthwhile purpose in being ready to service what I though I needed as I settled out into my life without Scn, and I am sure there are many, many more like myself.</p> <p>How many others on the edge, but still indoctrinated heavily into the Hubbard system Mark summarized above can be released from it by persons who can service in accordance to those procedures while at the same time, opening their clients&#8217; eyes to the idea it might all be a placebo after all.

Year after year, knowing full well that if your secret judgment or disagreement was picked up by the needle it potentially meant:</p> <p>1) word clearing<br /> 2) Ethics<br /> 3) Declare<br /> 4) being declared PTS<br /> 5) If declared loosing family<br /> 6) if declared loosing friends<br /> 7) if declared loosing your &#8220;only road to spiritual freedom&#8221;<br /> 8) if working for or with Scientologists, loosing your job<br /> 9) being seen as an SP by family and friends.</p> <p>All of these fears being cemented in association with criticism of Hubbard. So if you do not want to experience any of the above. Keep your mouth shut and deny what your feel and perceive. Better yet, if you do have these thoughts, it&#8217;s because of your evil intentions. You are evil for criticizing Ron. </p> <p>I have felt that blow back. But it&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s all good. It&#8217;s good practice for me to be centered when folks think I&#8217;m a jerk.

I do not consider myself a scientologist; independent or otherwise. Yes, I had gains while participating in scientology. I also was very accomplished in life before scn and had many gains in other practices as well. I consider myself to be a person who could obtain gains in life because that was my viewpoint on life &#8211; gains to be had. </p> <p>Four years ago, I still retained respect for Ron Hubbard. Now I see him very differently.  Time and investigation and feeling safe to evaluate for myself, I see LRH and his probably intentions differently. </p> <p>Life is good.

People who believe point #7 to be true could not any longer be Scientologists, could they? That would be like a Christian saying &#8220;I am a Christian, even though I only am a Christian because the writings and practices were carefully designed and administered so as to lead me and other Christians to wholeheartedly accept and live according to my beliefs.&#8221; </p> <p>So, I think an earlier commenter (aotc) here was right in saying that #7 is what Marty (and many others here) believe to be true. Someone dissed aotc for that, but the disser was not as careful a reader as aotc. </p> <p>One of the core beliefs I have not seen mentioned here is, I think, the principle and most core belief of Scientology. That belief is &#8220;Ron is 100% right and none of the tech can be argued against.&#8221; This smothered out of existence a &#8220;belief&#8221; put forth in Scientology Zero materials: &#8220;What is true for you is what you have observed yourself to be true&#8221;, etc. This essay on personal integrity worked as a good TR4 to the newcomers&#8217; qualms when they first get in, but, after not very long, that stable datum was shaken and was replaced with KSW 1 and KSW 2 (Safeguarding Technology). It&#8217;s never, ever been right for a  true Scientology believer to consider for a moment that Ron could be wrong in anything, as far as I can tell. </p> <p>But the belief that Ron was always right and the &#8220;only one&#8221; who could be Source is the most important belief of all to inspect and then discard. Once a person does that, he can assign relative importances to all the various data of Scientology. That&#8217;s how I can still value much of Scientology, and disregard, or relegate to the trash heap, so much that is not of value or is harmful. </p> <p>We might liken Scientology to the notes of some  brilliant 18th century chemist who managed some break throughs. Trained chemists now might still marvel at some of this fellow&#8217;s discoveries and insight, but blush or shake their heads at other things once asserted as truth, that just did not turn out to be so. </p> <p>While looking at the other points, remember Marty introduces them as &#8220;religious beliefs&#8221;. Remember the etymology of religion &#8211; it&#8217;s from the Latin &#8220;religare&#8221; &#8211; a binding together. It&#8217;s things that a group or people hold together to be true. </p> <p>There is little or no distinction in this post or in the comments here between the beliefs of Ron and Scientologists and the technology of auditing. And it would be of more benefit in this discussion if such a distinction were made. </p> <p>Consider: </p> <p>a)if a person were to be audited all the way from Life Repair, through his Grades and Power Processing, even up to OT 2, and </p> <p>b) was not subjected to the indoctrination that is continually brought to a student or parishioner by virtue of course materials, books, policy letters, registrars, promotional pieces and events, then </p> <p>c) he might not believe ANY of the things brought up my Marty here. Consider: <b><i>He might not even have thought any of those things, let alone believe in them, without those sorts of influence.</i></b> </p> <p><i>These beliefs are not borne out of realizations attendant to auditing sessions. They are borne out of indoctrination brought to people by course materials, books, policy letters, registrars, ethics officers, FSMs, promo pieces, taped lectures, confidential briefings and upper level materials, etc.</i></p> <p>That may be why there are still a few people refusing to succumb to the ex-Church people who now want to lump all of their Scientology experience together and call it &#8220;bad&#8221;. </p> <p>I think that it might be therapeutic for some here to sit alone at a table and write out answers to these questions: &#8220;Have I benefited from Scientology?&#8221; &#8220;If so, how?&#8221;</p> <p>I&#8217;ve done that several times and it&#8217;s always been fun. You can call that hypnotism, if you like, you and John Atack can call it &#8220;increased levels of dopamine&#8221;, if you like. You can call it whatever you want. </p> <p>Call it &#8220;hypnotism&#8221; though, and I will respond with, &#8220;Yes, and what, exactly, is not hypnotism?&#8221; Cheering for your favorite Super Bowl team or anything else is a sort of hypnotism. Having good manners or a certain way of addressing elders is a programming, in some respects. Much of life is, for most of us, spent in a sort of hypnotized state. The red pill or the blue? Even the red pill is an illusion. </p> <p>If you are one of the blessed few for which life is not at least in part a hypnotic trance, I kneel before you in awe of your awesomeness. Cause baby, you&#8217;ve got it. </p> <p>Increased levels of dopamine? Running does that, and so does getting laid. These things are now wrong? Should we just be injecting ourselves with the stuff instead, or working to run or have sex without having increased levels of dopamine? </p> <p>I begrudge the use of the term &#8220;pop psychology&#8221; to dismiss any subject. I would not want to put ANY subject under that umbrella, not even bumper sticker stuff or facebook feel good memes. I don&#8217;t think of Marty as being snarky, but that feels snarky to me. In being described, the subject deserves better than that. </p> <p>Scientology has not been asserted in to our lives. It&#8217;s not some cruel demonic inky black stuff that engulfed us that we now have to exorcise from our lives. It&#8217;s a subject that we thrived in, toiled under, found thrills in, and feel betrayed by. It&#8217;s a lot like every other area of life. </p> <p>So, why be miserable about it? I know Jews that whine about their upbringing, and Catholics too. I think that less than 1% of us have been brought up properly. And we&#8217;re assaulted by undue influence on a daily basis by marketers and politicians. </p> <p>So what? There&#8217;s always been something rough going on here, making life a bit of a bitch. Once it was saber tooth tigers and tar pits. Now we have politicians, marketers and religions. About the same thing, I think.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire even depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329365"> 		<div id="comment-329365"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329365"> 				February 4, 2015 at 12:57 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329365#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329365", "329365", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p><b>SCIENTOLOGY (minus) INDOCTRINATION &amp; HYPNOTISM = MINDFULNESS.</b></p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329387"> 		<div id="comment-329387"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a1049d2528a46f6bd92dca4577fd768f?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://www.unicef.org/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Cat Daddy</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329387"> 				February 4, 2015 at 5:57 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329387#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329387", "329387", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Cat Daddy'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>That is why I distrusted mindfullness at first and bodyscan and the lot I do at my place of work besides the working there.

However, if a person was subject to auditing outside of the cult infrastructure up to OT 2, that person would still be required to believe lots and lots of L Ron Hubbard&#8217;s bullshit, just as the auditor does. Things like the &#8220;reactive mind&#8221;. There is no evidence for a &#8220;reactive mind&#8221;, so how can anyone insist it exists? The most likely background to the concept of the &#8220;reactive mind&#8221; is that its a perverse fusion of Freud&#8217;s &#8220;unconscious mind&#8221; and Korzybski&#8217;s theory of identification. Freud only ever used his concept as a model for understanding, whereas L Ron Hubbard insists that the reactive mind is an actuality, and then he jammed in things called &#8220;engrams&#8221;.  It doesn&#8217;t take too many keystrokes to source scientific evidence &#8211; which L Ron Hubbard helped compile &#8211; confirming there is no such thing as an &#8220;engram&#8221; as defined by L Ron Hubbard. Then there&#8217;s the e-meter which, according to the technology of auditing. &#8220;. . . passes a tiny current through the preclear&#8217;s body. This current is influenced by the mental masses, pictures, circuits and machinery. When the unclear pc thinks of something, these mental items shift and this registers on the meter . . . &#8221; Again, this is utter bullshit. The e-meter certainly measures something, but it is not what L Ron Hubbard says it is even if L Ron Hubbard believed it when he wrote it. </p> <p>And so it goes on. Bit by bit, gradient by gradient: the auditor&#8217;s attempt to slowly inject L Ron Hubbard&#8217;s beliefs, which the auditor has adopted as their own, into the mind of the PC. Accordingly, there can be no differentiation between the beliefs of L Ron Hubbard and the technology of auditing.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire even depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329459"> 		<div id="comment-329459"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329459"> 				February 5, 2015 at 7:23 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329459#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329459", "329459", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Good point!<br /> .</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-iamvalkov odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330239"> 		<div id="comment-330239"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/742817c1603c6e5f9f5086f4763a57b5?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://valkovuddin.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>iamvalkov</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330239"> 				February 17, 2015 at 5:28 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330239#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330239", "330239", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to iamvalkov'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m sorry,  but if you don&#8217;t know what the emeter measures, then how do you know it does not measure what Hubbard said it measured?</p> <p>Also,  &#8220;reactive mind&#8221; is as good a term as any in psychology or psychoanalysis.

The term “reactive mind” makes no such differentiation. Think about it: reactions can be entirely conscious and monitored, they can even be pre-determined.

Unless this person was also indoctrinated thusly. </p> <p>Fundamental Christianity has in it some pretty barbaric aspects, particularly in the Old Testament. There we have stonings, whole populations being rubbed out by a vengeful God, etc. The New Testament, while less barbaric, doesn&#8217;t sit well with a lot of today&#8217;s sophisticated people for various reasons, including Paul&#8217;s views about women and homosexuality. </p> <p>Various Christian thinkers have managed to get past the &#8220;it&#8217;s ALL God&#8217;s Word and it&#8217;s ALL got to be followed&#8221;, and have basically asked themselves, &#8220;What&#8217;s workable and generally improves conditions?&#8221; and they take those things and preach and practice on the workable and leave all else alone. Ernest Holme&#8217;s Church of Religious Science is an excellent example of this. Hinduism is full of brilliant information and guidance; it&#8217;s also full of myth. Certainly there&#8217;s many people who have been able to decipher the difference between the good and bad. </p> <p>Islam is another example, with the most dangerous being those who want to follow all the Prophet&#8217;s words, and it&#8217;s unfortunate that his later teachings were venomous; his earliest teachings very loving. So there are fundamentalists there beheading and stoning, and other&#8217;s who have filtered out the hatred.</p> <p>Such <i>could be</i>a &#8220;new way&#8221; to teach Scientology. Label the balderdash and non-sensical and harmful any way you want, but move it off the line up.  I think there&#8217;s many in the Indie Field doing just that. Although these beliefs Marty has enumerated are certainly embedded in the Church and in many church-goers; there is lots and lots of material that are not influenced by these beliefs and do much to bring relief and a clearer view of things to people. There&#8217;s a lot left over. </p> <p>I think that there&#8217;s many people who have benefited from Scientology in a similar fashion to your roommate or partner. And there&#8217;s also lots of people who held on to their personal integrity while being on org lines studying. Just because these points have been put forward by Ron and then advanced by many, there are plenty of people who filter these nonsensical or harmful things out. Very few people at the Washington Times personally advanced the aims of their owner, the Unification Church. We are not infected with the principles of Christian Science if we read the Monitor&#8217;s book and movie reviews. </p> <p>Here we are on Marty&#8217;s blog. Perhaps a few thousand of us have commented over the years. How many of us have employed Scientology in  such a way as to hurt another since we have left the Church? I think there are very few or any of us here who have done that. </p> <p>I think that most of those still active in the corporate Church are tolerating these beliefs. less than accepting them. And I think that is true with many of us here. And, just as there was a &#8220;breaking point&#8221; for us, there will be a &#8220;breaking point&#8221; for many of them. The ranks of &#8220;exes&#8221; bailing is greater every day. There are 3 people who have told me they are under the radar to every one person I know who has said publicly that they have left.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329548"> 		<div id="comment-329548"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62094ea8485520b990be9f9d0dd38dd2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">TheOracle</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329548"> 				February 5, 2015 at 6:46 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329548#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329548", "329548", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to TheOracle'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Good points.

I think we should get together and establish a pop psychology practice. Let&#8217;s call it it &#8220;Playology&#8221; A lot like Scientology, but without ethics policies, bad guys and space opera. Here&#8217;s my proposed 8 beliefs:</p> <p>1. Planet Earth is a playground. The vast majority of human beings – and billions of invisible other beings – are your team mates. We are here to express and experience freedom, growth and joy. </p> <p>2. Steve Irwin (aka &#8220;The Crocodile Hunter&#8221;) was the name of the hero of our pop psychologist group. Steve established Earth as a playground and transported billions of beings to serve as our fellow team mates. </p> <p>3. Our continued state of play is assured by stand up comedians, late-night talk show hosts, friendly people we meet in day to day life, ex-Scientologists and people who write critically about Scientology without having any first hand experience with it. The males are from Mars, and the girls are from Venus. </p> <p>4. Dan Locke and The Oracle were all amongst the first few billion to have discovered the truth of 1 through 3 above, and are not the only ones who have devised means of enjoying life on this planet, and wanting to immerse themselves in the experience of it, and can&#8217;t imagine why anyone would want to escape from it.</p> <p>5. It&#8217;s of vital importance in our group that we don&#8217;t consider there&#8217;s only one hole in any wall and that it&#8217;s typically not necessary to navigate through holes in walls. It&#8217;s usually fine to let a hole in a wall just continue to be there, and not go through it. If one decides to go through a hole in a wall, it&#8217;s usually only necessary to determine if the any of the available holes are wide enough to pass through or can be made wide enough, and this can be done usually without skills in navigation. </p> <p>We also recognize that going around the wall or through  a door are frequently available options. </p> <p>It is also important to answer the age-old question many of us have suffered with over the ages, that being the question, &#8220;What wall???&#8221; </p> <p>6. Playologists don&#8217;t have enemies.  About as bad as it gets for a playologist is to encounter people they haven&#8217;t yet quite figured out.  </p> <p>7. Playology ‘technology’ consists of a sophisticated mix of &#8220;pop&#8221; psychology and hypnotism carefully designed and administered so as to lead people to wholeheartedly accept and live according to these beliefs. In keeping with &#8220;pop culture&#8221;, we do our best to keep up with what&#8217;s trending, and mod clothing. We are pretty split on the whole Justin Bieber thing. </p> <p>8. When a playologist has expended all of his best efforts in the vibrant pursuit of these beliefs he is expected to belch loudly and shout &#8220;Huzzah&#8221; and laugh as others wonder what &#8220;huzzah&#8221; means. All playologists eventually &#8220;die&#8221;, usually while laughing or after extraordinarily satisfying sex.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-6 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329684"> 		<div id="comment-329684"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62094ea8485520b990be9f9d0dd38dd2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">TheOracle</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329684"> 				February 6, 2015 at 7:32 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329684#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329684", "329684", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to TheOracle'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>LAUGHTER!

Just like any regular poster here at &#8220;Movin&#8217; On Up&#8221;, the person TO is living with is not in any way a Scientologist by Scientology&#8217;s own definition. This person doesn&#8217;t call themself a Scientologist. The OP is talking about Scientology beliefs &#8211; why on Earth would any non-Scientologist believe any Scientology let alone the core beliefs as delineated by Marty? </p> <p>The remainder of your comment, I suggest, is invalid in that it seeks to draw a false equivalence. This is because Scientology is not a religion. For it to be valid to describe Scientology as a religion the definition of the term &#8220;religion&#8221; would have to include as a qualifier something like this:</p> <blockquote><p> &#8220;an organisation which systematically and covertly applies hypnotic-like practises against adherents in order to gain deeply personal and other information for subsequent use against the person so as to extract cash and/or protect the on-going functioning of the organisation&#8221;.</p></blockquote> <p>Now, while that qualifier is an accurate description of the day-to-day and on-going core business of Scientology, it also excludes Scientology for consideration as a religion. </p> <p>A valid equivalence with which to measure Scientology would be with criminal organisations such as the Mafia, the Hells Angels, the Tongs, the Triads, and so on.

He does a petty good exposition of the roles of each in and the different realms of knowledge involved in ech.  Kool-aide drinkers like current CoS members are introverted into their own subjectivity;  some critics seem compulsively extraverted to the opposite extreme.   From my own pre-scientology experiece, here is an example:  Back in the 1960s, I took some LSD,  and prmptly went out the top of my head(not &#8220;3 feet behind it&#8221;, but straight up).    Of course the LSD experience varied from person to person,  but some of the &#8220;expert&#8221; &#8220;authorities&#8221; who had never taken it authoritatively stated that my experience was a &#8220;hallucination&#8221;  or &#8220;delusion&#8221;.<br /> How in the world could they know what it was?</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire odd alt depth-8 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330404"> 		<div id="comment-330404"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330404"> 				February 20, 2015 at 1:29 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330404#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330404", "330404", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>A person audited on Scientology Grade 0 has to agree with Hubbard&#8217;s definition of communication, a being, and the importance of &#8220;I&#8221;.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329326"> 		<div id="comment-329326"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://i2.wp.com/graph.facebook.com/v2.2/638982191/picture?q=type%3Dlarge&#038;resize=48%2C48' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://www.facebook.com/638982191' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Dan Locke</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329326"> 				February 4, 2015 at 1:05 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329326#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329326", "329326", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Dan Locke'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m &#8220;coming out&#8221; as &#8220;pro-pop psychology&#8221;. </p> <p>Defined: &#8220;Popular psychology (or pop psychology or pop psych) is the concepts and theories about human mental life and behavior that are purportedly based on psychology and that find credence among and pass muster with the populace.

It even preceded &#8220;The Power of Positive Thinking&#8221; by two years. Living in the USA, prior to 1950, if you wanted to find encouragement and validation for &#8220;being you&#8221; and being alive, you found it from a family member or from a popular song lyrics, not from a non-fiction book. It&#8217;s true that there was psychology before Dianetics, but it was not popular, and it did not validate or encourage human potential or &#8220;being awake&#8221;.</p> <p>I think that &#8220;pop psychology&#8221; has been a &#8220;It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life&#8221;&#8216;s George Bailey type of influence on our culture &#8211; and that&#8217;s brought a lot of good.

I understand the sources for what indicates to you as truth, as you have noted these in you essays.  I would never actually question what indicates to you as truth, as I do not feel that my personal truth (or L. Ron Hubbard&#8217;s) is in any way superior to yours.  But as you keep mentioning your truth as THE TRUTH to point out how untrue other peoples&#8217; truths are, I have asked you more than once (though you will never answer me) HOW you know your truth about the properties of a being is true, but axiom one is not.  Now if your answer is that your truth indicates to you more or feels more right, why not just say s0?  That would be real to me.

I could go into an ego-reinforcing description of exactly how and why I am grateful, but I believe it is self evident to anyone who practices mindfulness and has undergone the Scientology indoctrination process (technical training as a Snr. C/S in my case).</p> <p>Don </p> <p>I shall give you THE FALSE DATUM of Scientology that is embedded in Scientology Axiom #1, and which is expressed here in Scientology 8-8008:</p> <p>“One of the control mechanisms which has been used on thetans is that when they rise in potential they are led to believe themselves one with the universe. This is distinctly untrue. Thetans are individuals. They do not as they rise up the scale, merge with other individualities. They have the power of becoming anything they wish while still retaining their own individuality. They are first and foremost themselves. There is evidently no Nirvana. It is the feeling that one will merge and lose his own individuality that restrains the thetan from attempting to remedy his lot. His merging with the rest of the universe would be his becoming matter. This is the ultimate in cohesiveness and the ultimate in affinity, and is at the lowest point of the tone-scale. One declines into a brotherhood with the universe.”</p> <p>There goes love, compassion and kindness in Scientology with the US versus THEY thinking of THETA-MEST theory. MEST does not come from theta to entrap theta. Individuality does not merge with MEST in Nirvana. That is Hubbard bullshit. </p> <p>Theta and MEST are two aspects of the same system. In Nirvana there is neither MEST nor individuality to serve as the boundary. There is simply no boundary.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-martyrathbun09 comment-author-is-site-member bypostauthor even depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329511"> 		<div id="comment-329511"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c2d94d163a566268e73c8b0195b6c03a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Mark C.

Not at you or what you shared but at the insanity of this world, this cosmos.  Over the seeming years I have imagined many scenarios regarding the who, what, where and why of this character L. Ron Hubbard.  Finally, I came to recognize that this identity emerged in my experience of consciousness as a projection, a manifestation, of my own unconscious guilt, fear and self-hate.  I have played this particular story line so, so many times (like portrayed in the movie Ground Hog Day) never waking up, never getting the lesson and the experience always having the same outcome.  This time, though, something happened, and I finally made a different choice.  A choice that put me on the path of waking up and getting a very important lesson.  For me, L.

Thanks for the video clip of Wayne Dyer.  I have seen this particular presentation of his on PBS numerous times in its entirety and always benefited by doing so.</p> <p>His quote that you shared is one of those that requires absolutely no debate but invites one to embark on the simple journey of personal exploration and experience.  How difficult could it be for one to pick something that they hold a belief on as to how that something is, then choose to change the way they look at it and and observe how the perception of that &#8216;something&#8217; changes (or not) after doing so?</p> <p>Personally, just taking the subjects of L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology&#8230;I couldn&#8217;t begin to count the number of times I have changed the way I look at them. And with each change in view came a change in perception and interpretation.</p> <p>The world I see is the world I have invented through both my conscious and unconscious beliefs about the world.  Everything I perceive means to me what I have decided for it to mean thus there is no truth or facts in time that I can share with what would seem to be another.

Everything I perceive means to me what I have decided for it to mean&#8230;:</p> <p>I think there is a lot of truth to what you say. However, dear Monte, I&#8217;m not sure I would agree with what you wrote here:</p> <p>&#8220;&#8230;thus there is no truth or facts in time that I can share with what would seem to be another.&#8221;</p> <p>Tell me what you think of this passage from Dan Brown&#8217;s book *The Lost Symbol*, in which a speaker by the name of Peter Solomon is addressing a student body:</p> <p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br /> &#8230;Solomon said, “I find it wondrous to note that throughout history, all of mankind’s disparate philosophies have all concurred on one thing – that a great enlightenment is coming. In every culture in every era, in every corner of the world, the human dream has focused on the same exact concept – the coming apotheosis of man…the impending transformation of our human minds into their true potentiality.“ he smiled. “What could possibly explain such a synchronicity of beliefs?”</p> <p>“Truth,” said a quiet voice in the crowd. </p> <p>Solomon wheeled. “Who said that?”</p> <p>The hand that went up belonged to a tiny Asian boy whose soft features suggested he might be Nepalese or Tibetan. “Maybe there is a universal truth embedded in everyone’s soul. Maybe we ALL have the same story hiding inside, like a shared constant in our DNA. Maybe this collective TRUTH is responsible for the similarity in all of our stories.”</p> <p>Solomon was beaming as he pressed his hands together and bowed reverently to the boy. “Thank you.”</p> <p>Everyone was quiet.</p> <p>“Truth”, Solomon said, addressing the room. “Truth has power.

It&#8217;s profound.  I&#8217;ll give you my interpretation of what is communicated in the last paragraph of the excerpt and then some. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span>  That paragraph being:</p> <p>“Truth has power. And if we all gravitate toward similar ideas, maybe we do so because those ideas are TRUE . . . written deep within us. And when we hear the truth, even if we don’t understand it, we feel that truth resonate within us . . . vibrating with our unconscious wisdom. Perhaps the truth is not LEARNED by us, but rather, the truth is re-called . . .re-membered . . . re-cognized . . . as that which is already inside us.”</p> <p>TRUTH IS.  I am, you are, we are TRUTH.  TRUTH is not fragmented, there are no degrees of when it comes to TRUTH.  TRUTH is not just &#8216;inside us&#8217; it is us.  However, in our identifying with the human condition we believe that TRUTH exists outside of us and needs to be sought for, discovered and learned.  We do not know that WE ARE and we are terrified of knowing who WE REALLY ARE.  Therefore, we have made a universe of perception that appears to have a subject and object, a cause and an effect and in this universe we hide from TRUTH.  In the fragmented universe of perception where each seeming individual identity can determine their own truth and where truth is always seen to exist outside of the individual&#8230;TRUTH is obscured.  You could say that TRUTH is the ever shinning Sun and perception is the system of clouds that continually block the light of the Sun.</p> <p>In the universe of perception all I can perceive through my senses is the past.  BTW, my senses constantly affirm that there is indeed a world of form that exists outside of myself and in perception &#8216;myself&#8217; is nothing but a construct.that I identify with.  What resembles truth in the universe of perception is based on observations, comparisons, evaluations and judgments that are filtered through myriad belief systems that exist both consciously and unconsciously. In the universe of perception no two individuals will ever join in an exact truth.</p> <p>The universe of perception is nothing but a dream that we believe to be quite real and we act toward it as if it is real.  The universe of perception is a very strange place indeed.  It is a place where the individual is never complete and there is always more to want and more to get.  The good news is though, that regardless of how incredibly inventive we get, we can never escape from being who and what WE REALLY ARE. </p> <p>WE ARE TRUTH. WE ARE KNOWLEDGE. WE ARE LOVE. WE ARE ETERNAL. WE ARE EVERYTHING AND WE ARE NO THING.</p> <p>Isn&#8217;t it interesting that the very things we want and are in constant pursuit of in the world of perception i.e., truth, knowledge, love and immortality&#8230;are the very things WE ARE and always will be.  Indeed, WE have never been anything else,  This is why ALL paths taken in the universe of perception eventually and inevitably arrive at the same place&#8230;TRUTH.  It cannot be otherwise.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330105"> 		<div id="comment-330105"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/350d54331c090bcdace0f231815a0dd3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">marildi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330105"> 				February 13, 2015 at 10:38 pm</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Monte, beautifully said.

You introduced me to it about a year ago, right here on Marty&#8217;s. The title is &#8220;&#8216;I&#8217; = Awareness&#8221;. Here&#8217;s the abstract:</p> <p>&#8220;Introspection reveals that the core of subjectivity — the `I&#8217; — is identical to awareness. This `I&#8217; should be differentiated from the various aspects of the physical person and its mental contents which form the `self&#8217;. Most discussions of consciousness confuse the `I&#8217; and the `self&#8217;. In fact, our experience is fundamentally dualistic — not the dualism of mind and matter — but that of the `I&#8217; and that which is observed. The identity of awareness and the `I&#8217; means that we know awareness by being it, thus solving the problem of the infinite regress of observers. It follows that whatever our ontology of awareness may be, it must also be the same for `I&#8217;.&#8221;</p> <p>The article is summed up with the following:</p> <p>&#8220;KNOWING BY BEING THAT WHICH IS KNOWN [my caps] is ontologically different from perceptual knowledge. That is why someone might introspect and not see awareness or the `I&#8217;, concluding&#8230;that it doesn&#8217;t exist. But thought experiments and introspective meditation techniques are able to extract the one who is looking from what is seen, restoring the missing centre.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Once we grant the identity of `I&#8217; and awareness we are compelled to extend to the core subjective self whatever ontological propositions seem appropriate for awareness. If awareness is non-local, so is the essential self. If awareness transcends material reality so does the `I&#8217;. If awareness is declared to be non-existent then that same conclusion must apply to the `I&#8217;. No matter what one&#8217;s ontological bias, recognition that `I&#8217; = awareness has profound implications for our theoretical and personal perspective.&#8221;</p> <p><a href="http://www.imprint.co.uk/online/Deikman.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.imprint.co.uk/online/Deikman.html</a></p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire even depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330173"> 		<div id="comment-330173"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330173"> 				February 16, 2015 at 8:35 am</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Marildi, this is human self-centric view of awareness.

He came pretty close to articulating it in the &#8220;Conclusion&#8221;, where he said “Knowing by being that which is known is ontologically different from perceptual knowledge. That is why someone might introspect and not SEE awareness or the `I’ &#8211; concluding…that it doesn’t exist. To me, “SEE awareness” is another way of saying “aware of being aware” or “awareness of awareness.” </p> <p>But the article you posted the link to explicitly expresses the idea of &#8220;awareness of awareness&#8221;  And I would agree – it is a very good description of OT-TR0.</p> <p>I think we&#8217;re also in agreement that plants and many animals (perhaps not all) are &#8220;aware&#8221; (obviously) but not &#8220;aware of being aware&#8221; &#8211; and thus, it would seem, they are &#8220;one with the universe&#8221; (their environment).</p> <p>marildi xo</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-christianscientology odd alt depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330601"> 		<div id="comment-330601"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/535874aa14b2cef0c4574543b07e8463?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">christianscientology</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330601"> 				February 24, 2015 at 6:02 am</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Not so much of the &#8216;Ol&#8217;!<br /> Yes for me and I know for you it is the concept of the AWARENESS of AWARENESS that sets Scientology apart from most other attempts to figure out how the mind works.

It has everything to do with this idea of unconditional love &#8211; expressed by Jesus as &#8220;Love thy neighbor&#8221; &#8211; and it bridges the gap between ARC and universal love. In other words, one can indeed reach Love through Understanding &#8211; which only makes sense if you think about it.</p> <p>I hadn&#8217;t thought about this before but the bulletin also correlates with physics. In the realm of aberration, the principle in operation is from Newton physics &#8211; which is linear. But there is also a correlation with quantum physics &#8211; in the sense of life units being entangled. And experiments have now shown that not just particles but life itself can be entangled. (Yet another example of LRH&#8217;s insights being &#8220;re-discovered&#8221;.)</p> <p>Here&#8217;s the relevant excerpt from the bulletin (my caps for emphasis):</p> <p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br /> &#8220;The theory that what you do to others will then happen to you is a punishment control mechanism peculiar to this universe. It derives from a deteriorated willingness to duplicate. IT IS THE LAW OF PHYSICS OF INTERACTION &#8211; FOR EVERY ACTION THERE IS AN EQUAL AND CONTRARY REACTION.</p> <p>&#8220;&#8216;Love thy neighbor&#8217;, when it is no longer a willingness, is enforced by the theory of O/W. &#8216;Love thy neighbor&#8217; can exist only when help, control and communication are high. When all these go, then O-W comes into vogue as a method of enforcing peace.</p> <p>&#8220;O-W is a theory which sets in when aberration sets in. It is not a high natural law. It is junior to the various laws of Communication, Control and Help.</p> <p>&#8220;O-W can occur only when help has failed. Help is a CO-JOINING OF VECTORS OF LIFE.</p> <p>&#8220;When two BEINGS WHO HAVE JOINED FORCES to help fail each other, only then does O-W come into existence.</p> <p>&#8220;THE FORCES OF TWO BEINGS CANNOT COME INTO DISPUTE UNTIL AFTER THEY HAVE FIRST JOINED. Thus there is no war like that seen between brothers or husband and wife.&#8221;</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-christianscientology odd alt depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330329"> 		<div id="comment-330329"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/535874aa14b2cef0c4574543b07e8463?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">christianscientology</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330329"> 				February 19, 2015 at 7:12 am</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hello again Marildi</p> <p>That directive by Jesus to &#8220;love thy neighbour&#8221; is not complete, the rest is &#8220;as you love yourself&#8221;.

I was particularly interested in your last statement &#8220;WE ARE NO THING&#8221; this is where Scientology makes its fundamental mistake.  Having first established that man is a NO THING that is THETA, it then goes on to speaking about a THETAN.  So WHO YOU TRULY ARE is THETA,  WHO YOU REALLY ARE IS A THETAN.  In other words you are A THETAN by AGREEMENT.  This handles the apparent paradox of how we can be ONE and separate INDIVIDUALS at the same time, in fact, INDIVISIBLE and INDIVIDUAL come from the same root, as I have said before.</p> <p>Love and Understanding<br /> Pip</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-iamvalkov odd alt depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330256"> 		<div id="comment-330256"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/742817c1603c6e5f9f5086f4763a57b5?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://valkovuddin.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>iamvalkov</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330256"> 				February 17, 2015 at 7:37 pm</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Deikman&#8217;s essay makes some sense to me.

In other words, not the previous life identity or any other . Just an awareness of his existence. </p> <p>The other thing I thought of is the time you experienced a communion with me(!) <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> one morning, and then you wrote about it in a comment here.

You ask what, in light of what Rupert is saying, my understanding is of the experience of our spiritual communion.  Well marildi, this is going to possibly seem like a cop out on my part, but I have to say that I don&#8217;t have an understanding of that experience.  However, there is the experience and somehow I know that there is the experience.  I could easily fabricate some understanding of the experience and perhaps even present this understanding in a convincing manner that would at least give it merit enough to appear worthy of your consideration.  And, marildi, not all that long ago this is a likely scenario as to how I would have responded to your question.  Now, though, I realize that when it comes to that which is abstract e.g., consciousness, the mind, eternity, love, truth, knowledge, and so on&#8230;I do not know or understand anything.  Now that being said, I must add that I do not recognize any other individual that seemingly appears to me as being one who knows or understands either.  I do, though, seem to benefit in examining the interpretations, in their many creative forms, as offered by others&#8230;even if they are offering what they&#8217;re saying as being true (that, I believe, is the result of an incredibly common training program).  As long as one realizes that when it comes to addressing the abstract from the realm of perception there is no truth or understanding to be had, one can remain free to explore, look and adjust their desires, beliefs and interpretations as they see fit.</p> <p>Take care marildi.  I always enjoy our exchanges.

Ran with Scientology celebrities, was in the Sea Org, was the first artist to perform at celebrity center when Yvonne got the OK to restart Celebrity Center on La Brea, was a Missionaire to find a new New York Org directly connected to Ron in the early seventies.<br /> So I have experience.</p> <p>My present view of Ron now, I know this can sound crazy to some, is that he is a sort of Raksaha as is talked about in Indian scriptures. He is a lower class of being who has certain powers and is inherently opposed to Righteousness and Dharma. </p> <p>He preaches a doctrine which is completely the opposite of any sage. He preaches a doctrine of eternal seperateness, eternal ego and hates Christ, hates Yoga, hates the concept of God as omnipresent, puts hate above sympathy on the tone scale, loves Crowley, says he&#8217;s the Prince of Darkness, say&#8217;s he&#8217;s Lucifer, says he&#8217;s the Beast 666.</p> <p>Metaphysically speaking L Ron Hubbard is NOT a being of the Light. </p> <p>Empathy and sympathy is considered a weakness by him.</p> <p>The family unit is made into the product of genetic ghosts and IS doctrinal source of all this family agony.</p> <p>L Ron Hubbard metaphysically speaking is a being from the dark side. Just look at the fruits. </p> <p>He knew and had certain hypnotic abilities and he used them not just in a stage entertainment way, he used them in a nefarious metaphysical way to create an empire of the cult of personality, power, money and control.</p> <p>Ask yourselves this question. When you think of the concepts or reality of God, where does your mind go? </p> <p>L Ron Hubbard hated God. L Ron Hubbard said that the only god that ever was is you. He said that, I read that.</p> <p>L Ron Hubbard payed no homage to any reality other than if it is true for you it is true.</p> <p>L Ron Hubbard was who he said he was. The Prince of Darkness, Lucifer and the Beast 666.</p> <p>What I mean by that is not that he was actually these symbolic personalities, but that because he enjoyed the monikers with a chuckle on one of his tapes, he reveals his own spiritual state as a man who is repulsed by common standards of decency.</p> <p>And beyond simple common standards of decency he was on the dark side of the metaphysical spectrum.</p> <p>He hate Christ. Christ stood for love.</p> <p>You and I were duped by a dark ignorant soul who had some psychic powers of manifestation, and a con mans understanding of the mind and spirit.</p> <p>&#8220;the truth though always fought, always in the end prevails&#8221; L Ron Hubbard</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-7 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329764"> 		<div id="comment-329764"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a1049d2528a46f6bd92dca4577fd768f?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://www.unicef.org/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Cat Daddy</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329764"> 				February 7, 2015 at 7:17 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329764#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329764", "329764", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Cat Daddy'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Bravo.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even depth-7 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330031"> 		<div id="comment-330031"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d616319c9b45470e765e5dca0049c183?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Monte</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330031"> 				February 11, 2015 at 3:03 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330031#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330031", "330031", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Monte'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Brian, I too used to believe this&#8230;&#8221;but others do have an independent existence outside of our mental understanding and projection of them.&#8221;  However, this belief ever so gradually gave way to the belief that the idea of there being individual beings is a misperception where what is unreal is accepted as being real.

Yet, somehow I know of it and I feel pulled to it as do we all whether it is recognized or not.</p> <p>A few synonyms for the symbol &#8216;absolute&#8217; :  truth, knowledge, love, eternal, peace, consistency, mind, consciousness, God, light.  In the relative (what I refer to as being the universe of perception) these symbols point to the abstract that is beyond the relative as the relative and absolute cannot exist simultaneously.  Being that we cannot define or explain the abstract we invent all manner of symbols, stories, metaphors and allegories to point to the ineffable.  Unfortunately, though, the pointers are all to often interpreted to be literal and conflict with one another.</p> <p>The relative is both fragmented and fragmenting. It is constantly dividing, subdividing and compartmentalizing.   It is complex and complicated.  Everything that exists within the relative exists in a perpetual state of incompleteness.  In the relative MORE and LESS in are symbolized and manifested in form in seemingly infinite ways.  MORE and LESS sit as the ever ruling Gods of the relative and demand measurement, comparison and judgement of everything perceived.  In the relative where nothing is seen as being complete but is always in a state of needing, wanting more&#8230;all of the conflicting wants bring about a constant state of chaos.</p> <p>Brian, is it possible for there to be more than everything?  Can the waves ever really leave the ocean?  Can a singularity ever leave itself?  Can an absolute ever not be an absolute?</p> <p>I would say no to all the above questions.  However, the existence of a relative seems to prove otherwise doesn&#8217;t it.?  Personally, though, I believe that the relative and all its components is an unreality, an illusion, a dream, an hallucination.  I believe that we can never be anything other that what we are.

Yes, it (Local Orgs) may not be like it used to be, but I believe the internet has 3rd partied and frightened many people and money is TIGHT. There are millions of people who have had life changing gains through Sci &#8211; but they are &#8220;encouraged&#8221; not to go on entheta websites to comment; because it really does make you PTS when someone is insulting and lying about your personal endeavors, but if they could I&#8217;m sure 1000&#8217;s would stick up for their Church. Since I&#8217;m an old fart and will probably not be able to go into an Org again in the near future, and I&#8217;m quite certain about my personal wins and gains &#8211; I can &#8220;enjoy&#8221; all the various comments here and on Rinders/Tony&#8217;s site. Keep in mind too there are only a few hundred &#8220;noisy&#8221; individuals (haters) who obsess about &#8220;getting DM&#8221;. Maybe I would want to &#8220;get&#8221; him too, but I do not feel I was harmed by his actions. If you were personaly harmed &#8211; then have at it I suppose, but to blame him for all the trouble the Church is experiencing may be the wrong target, possibly LRH did leave a battleplan or LRHED to be excuted when the Church gained TAX FREE status. I can&#8217;t see LRH just dying and not leaving some plan to follow based or triggered on certain &#8220;events&#8221; i.e. tax free status, wars, crime stats, etc.  </p> <p>For me, after 40 years as a Scio &#8211; I really do see the Church of Scientology making good headway on the 4th D &#8211; maybe the 1st D focus has fallen behind, but we need a safe environment 1st in order to get trained and audited.

This has been going on for at least 7 years, hot and heavy. Not only that, but the pressure is still high for trainees from orgs, OTs redoing their Bridge with GAT 2, and such. In short, the &#8220;true believers&#8221;. Local orgs, if not ideal, essentially don&#8217;t have the right to hold on to their public, apparently. The &#8216;net really doesn&#8217;t have much to do with it. True believers don&#8217;t look at it anyway. Any outward advertising is targeted mainly to keep the true believers convinced the church is expanding. It&#8217;s pretty sordid.</p> <p>Millions of people is a pretty high number. I hope you are counting since 1950 and also the ripple effect for people who actually got better. That said, that number is a bit out of your hat as well. What possible factual figures would you be looking at?</p> <p>Yup &#8211; there are haters for sure. There are lots. Getting out of the church is a pretty daunting experience for many. Lots of odd emotional responses, and lots of confusion. However, there are easily many, many more who are trying to come to grips about what they have experienced, and how they let that happen to themselves, and so on.</p> <p>Personally I really don&#8217;t think DM is the problem, and he is an easy target. I think the more germane problem is how many let him get away with what he does. Once, when I was working in an org, there was an HCO interog regarding using physical violence against people in Scn. I can only imagine those poor MAA&#8217;s faces when they started realizing how far up the org board it went. And I would bet real money all many ultimately did was disconnect from the truth. When I realized how far up it did go, I simply stopped supporting anything Scn related, myself.</p> <p>However, many have quite loudly and vocally left and begun to call attention to those abuses, and I believe this is actually the ultimate undoing of the organization. Still, it is a hard pill to swallow when you see the church promoting HUman RIghts when the highest ecclisiastical members are regularly whistleblowing the lack thereof in their own organization. It&#8217;s like being a pornographer and supporting celibacy. Personally, I fail to see any good the church has done on the 4D. Following the logic of dynamics, it takes strong individuals to make strong groups to make strong impacts on a global scale. I don&#8217;t see how making slaves of one&#8217;s fellows is going to do any good for anyone, anywhere. Frankly, I don&#8217;t see how you can think so as well.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329512"> 		<div id="comment-329512"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/834912fb8622ab10c0c512c6b8941f81?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://gravatar.com/daretosayit' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>daretosayit</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329512"> 				February 5, 2015 at 2:04 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329512#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329512", "329512", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to daretosayit'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>And for what he did to Paulette Cooper and others who stood up to him.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329382"> 		<div id="comment-329382"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62094ea8485520b990be9f9d0dd38dd2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">TheOracle</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329382"> 				February 4, 2015 at 4:52 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329382#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329382", "329382", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to TheOracle'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I agree C Ann.

It is just a broader viewing of backstage activity.  Most people do not get invited in, as the Sea Org is highly secretive.  I do think as more members or Scientologists are informed of the real situations, they are going to have to take more responsibility. Perhaps all of it, and excuse the Sea Organization away from their lives.

There are no BELIEFS in Scientology.  It either works or it doesn’t work, it is basically a set of tools hence it really has nothing to do with belief.  On the other hand The Church of Scientology very definitely is a belief system, and it is impossible to embrace the belief system of the Church of Scientology and still maintain another belief system intact for the simple reason that for L.R.H. the Church of Scientology was and is his personal belief system hence he sees it as “the religion of religions” which I cannot help thinking may be where Alistair Crowley was coming from.</p> <p>Unfortunately once one has embraced the belief system of the Church of Scientology and found it wanting it is often the case that the person who has lost their faith in the “Church” also loses their belief in the workability of the technology of Scientology.</p> <p>It reminds me of what happens when a child loses respect for their parents and as a result rejects any good advice that those parents might offer.

There is a line in A COURSE IN MIRACLES that says “the blameless cannot blame”.  Please note there are two definitions for the word ‘critical’.  One is continuing or making severe or negative judgements.  The second is containing analytical evaluations.  To be negative about anything is to choose disharmony rather than harmony.</p> <p>If a person truly knows “who they are” it is impossible to blame anyone or anything, because the truth is everything I see in my external world is only a projection of my internal world.</p> <p>As for homosexuality, well there has been a revolution in that area over the past twenty years or so, something for me as a 73 year old I am still trying to catch up with.  However promiscuity whether homo. or hetro. is an indication of a chronic low tone.</p> <p>Since I never got further than Clear in the Church my knowledge of implants and BT’S is very sketchy.  I got fabulous results from my study of Scientology but then I long since stopped thinking I might find unconditional love in the Church. </p> <p>I find no conflict between admin. tech and any of the other tech.  I use ethics tech. in my business and admin tech but the difference is I endeavour not to let the tech become senior to the THETA (LOVE).  Where is my line between the two?

Take for instance “Communication is the universal solvent”.  Here is a very workable tool.  If I want to know something I need to communicate.  I can’t think of a single activity that does not involve communication of one sort or another.</p> <p>The “self-stated” purpose of Scientology is best expressed through the definition of a Scientologist, namely “one who has found a way to a better life and is actively achieving it by studying the material of Scientology” and that is certainly true for me.</p> <p>However I was fortunate to get thrown out of the Church before I had done any more than the Clearing Course.  I am Clear nine hundred and something.</p> <p>I say fortunate because if I hadn’t been I may not of found Jesus Christ and I would still be craving the love that attracted me to Scientology in the first place.</p> <p>Every human being who gets into Scientology craves unconditional love, and hoped they would find it in The Church and all they found was UNDERSTANDING and although that satisfies the mind the heart remains bereft. Only by reconnecting with our creator can the heart be satisfied.</p> <p>Take it from me only when the void at the centre of each being has been filled will the desperate search for ultimate meaning be over.</p> <p>Love with Understanding<br /> Pip</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-melyanna even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329353"> 		<div id="comment-329353"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/bddec305d33d9a0fd0af7c6bf2adb1d1?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://melyanna.tumblr.com/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Melyanna</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329353"> 				February 4, 2015 at 10:17 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329353#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329353", "329353", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Melyanna'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Any cult that presented a smiliar set of beliefs in this exact way would be viewed by most people as a fad, while Scientology has a big number of followers (compared to other &#8220;recent&#8221; cults anyway).<br /> I wonder if the practice of limiting access to some of these points until a person is much deeper into the study of Scientology is the only thing that makes a difference, or if there is some other factor that helps making this cult stand out and have more credibility.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329370"> 		<div id="comment-329370"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329370"> 				February 4, 2015 at 1:22 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329370#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329370", "329370", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Good question!

But there was a time when going into a Scientology Organization, (one far far away from&#8221;management&#8221; and the police force) meant having a lot of fun, with a lot of laid back people, who had very good intentions, were very helpful and respectful to the others. It was very fun and exciting and every one was having a really good time. It was very easy to buy courses and counseling. It was very accessible,nobody was paranoid,nobody was getting punished.  Really, you could do no wrong. THAT was a &#8220;safe environment where auditing could occur&#8221;.   That was when it was packed with curious (and educated) people.</p> <p>I do not think they have &#8221; a big number of followers&#8221; as you now suggest.</p> <p>It has been a real drag to walk into one of those places since 1982.  David Miscavige sent soldiers all the down into the streets and people&#8217;s living rooms to wipe out the missions (small intimate groups). Cutting off the feeder lines to the Orgs, and causing a mass exodus.</p> <p>You can see it reflected on these graphs in this article:</p> <p><a href="http://www.mikerindersblog.org/scientology-shriveling-media-take-note-they-lie-to-you/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mikerindersblog.org/scientology-shriveling-media-take-note-they-lie-to-you/</a></p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329514"> 		<div id="comment-329514"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0badc5640af149979f85ab7346205e34?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://gravatar.com/jumpingjack' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Jumping Jack</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329514"> 				February 5, 2015 at 2:09 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329514#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329514", "329514", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Jumping Jack'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;Big number of followers&#8221; &#8211; mmm&#8230;?

One is &#8220;the clear cog&#8221; which is contained in Viktor Frankl&#8217;s books as well many other works. The service facsimile is a related subject, but the specifics of it have been very helpful to me in looking at myself (and others) and seeing where life went off track, was too painful to confront, and the resulting &#8220;solution&#8221; which ever after, was clung to as if to a life raft. Fascinating stuff to me. I have witnessed others making lasting, life-changing gains, as well &#8211; the kind that everyone who knew them would observe. There&#8217;s some good stuff, for sure, but I have gotten more gains with it on my own, using it as I see fit, than I did in the church, where there was a suppressing agenda. I like to be able to pick and choose, not only from what I have learned through scn, but from the whole wide world of knowledge that is available. I did not interpret LRH&#8217;s &#8220;discard&#8221; of his body to have anything to do with what I should do. I thought it was all about his research.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329393"> 		<div id="comment-329393"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://i2.wp.com/graph.facebook.com/v2.2/650211981/picture?q=type%3Dlarge%26_md5%3Da108e6178a1096a312524e6ce79bb90d&#038;resize=48%2C48' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://www.facebook.com/650211981' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Daron Ryan</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329393"> 				February 4, 2015 at 6:35 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329393#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329393", "329393", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Daron Ryan'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thank you for publishing a clear, simple and largely objective description of Scientology.

The problem is that at the very heart of existence is a profound MYSTERY which can only be approached by FAITH (Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. – Hebrews 11:1 – King James Bible)</p> <p>What drew me into Scientology was the belief that I COULD KNOW but of course if you can know you don’t need faith, and without faith THERE IS NO HUMILITY, there is NO LOVE and certainly NO FORGIVENESS.</p> <p>For 40 years I have been communicating off and on with The Church of Scientology through the C.J.C here in England, and the reply is always the same “your only recourse is steps A to E, and my plea that I was never a Suppressive Person falls on deaf ears.</p> <p>You might well ask why do I persist. That is because I believe in the technology.  In the Seventies I was declared P.T.S. and was given an S &amp; D supervised by L.R.H. on board the then Royal Scotsman.  My item was SCIENTOLOGY – L.R.H. wrote in my P.C. folder “Give him his item and get him out of the area”. That left me two choices, 1) Handle my suppressive or 2) disconnect.  I chose the former, which brings us to P.T.</p> <p>It has been there in the Bible all along in the allegory of the Garden of Eden, we were never told we could not eat of the TREE OF LIFE but we were warned of the consequences of eating from the TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL, and of course the rest is history.</p> <p>Talking of history this video graphically shows what the results are when we believe that knowledge brings certainty.  <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x20ohne_bbc-ascent-of-man-11-knowledge-or-certainty_tv" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x20ohne_bbc-ascent-of-man-11-knowledge-or-certainty_tv</a> </p> <p>Love with ARC<br /> Pip</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329474"> 		<div id="comment-329474"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329474"> 				February 5, 2015 at 9:58 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329474#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329474", "329474", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>FIXED IDEAS = FALSE CERTAINTY = FALSE SECURITY = SCIENTOLOGY</p> <p>Why does one wants to be in good standing with Scientology?

they got involved.  Ron was a very capable man but humble he was not!</p> <p>The standard tests of humility he failed on miserably which are best expounded by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount Matthew chapters 5-6. Namely “Turn the other cheek” ”love your enemies” “do good to those that persecute you” “walk the extra mile” etc. These are sadly missing in the tenants of Scientology.</p> <p>I don’t think L.R.H. lacked faith, he just saw no place for it in his world view.</p> <p>Love<br /> Pip</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330079"> 		<div id="comment-330079"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/350d54331c090bcdace0f231815a0dd3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">marildi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330079"> 				February 12, 2015 at 11:01 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330079#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330079", "330079", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to marildi'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Pip, LRH actually does talk about faith. It’s at the top of one of the columns of the Chart of Attitudes. And here’s what he says about it in a lecture:</p> <p>“The first cause, the first prime thought, is TO BE – moving from a state of not-beingness to a state of beingness. That is a decision and that is a postulate. And once that is undertaken it airs out into the spheres of motion or activity in life. To continue being, of course, one has to go through these various changes, because the whole environment shifts. So does the individual. But this decision TO BE is ahead of all these other decisions, and the only thing that can happen after TO BE is modification. You can’t close out that first decision. The consistency of that first decision is very powerful, very strong. </p> <p>“This is the first act below faith. Faith is sort of above all this and faith is actually a state of not-beingness. Faith is the word which describes the life static. That emerges from faith.<br /> […]<br /> “This situation of being faith or having faith is very interesting. You are faith!” </p> <p>(from “CAUSE AND EFFECT &#8211; PART I, a lecture given on 19 November 1951, Being and Not Being”)</p> <p>Here’s the link if you want to read the whole transcript: <a href="http://www.matrixfiles.com/Scientology%20Materials/Tapes%20in%20order/5100c00%20Tape%20Transcripts/TXT/5111C19A%20CAUSE%20AND%20EFFECT%20-%20PART%20I.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.matrixfiles.com/Scientology%20Materials/Tapes%20in%20order/5100c00%20Tape%20Transcripts/TXT/5111C19A%20CAUSE%20AND%20EFFECT%20-%20PART%20I.txt</a></p> <p>Btw, I like this definition of “faith” from my Webster’s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary: “complete confidence”</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-christianscientology even depth-5 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330133"> 		<div id="comment-330133"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/535874aa14b2cef0c4574543b07e8463?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">christianscientology</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330133"> 				February 14, 2015 at 4:28 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330133#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330133", "330133", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to christianscientology'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hi Marildi<br /> Very interesting! &#8220;The first cause, the first prime thought, is TO BE&#8221;.  This is so true.  However as per the FACTORS it starts &#8220;BEFORE THE BEGINNING&#8221;, here is the SOURCE of FAITH.  As Ron says faith is above TO BE.  Scientology does not get involved in the area beyond TO BE (BEINGNESS) because beyond beingness the technology no longer applies.  This is the realm of UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, the realm of the EIGHTH DYNAMIC.  Here we find ONENESS instead of INDIVIDUALITY but where individuality is contained.  AFFINITY is a scale of attitudes that falls away from the CO-EXISTENCE OF STATIC, but LOVE (unconditional love) will forever be beyond affinity for affinity can not even exist unless DISTANCE is postulated.</p> <p>Thanks for that definition of faith and it works well in terms of M.E.S.T., but in terms of THETA I like UNDESERVED FAVOUR.</p> <p>Lots of love<br /> Pipx</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-6 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330165"> 		<div id="comment-330165"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/350d54331c090bcdace0f231815a0dd3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">marildi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330165"> 				February 15, 2015 at 10:06 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330165#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330165", "330165", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to marildi'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;&#8230;affinity can not even exist unless DISTANCE is postulated.&#8221;</p> <p>Generally, yes.

Although I have my own experience, I am sometimes aware of how my experience matches up to what is written in the Bible.  The Bible differentiates between the first cause and being.  In Chapter One it says that “man is made in the image and likeness of God” and it also says “God is spirit”.  In the second Chapter of Genesis it says “man became a living being”, not man was but man became.  Just as in the Factors it says “Before the beginning was a cause and the entire purpose of the cause was the creation of effect, IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE DECISION AND THE DECISION WAS TO BE.  From there MATTER, ENERGY, SPACE and TIME could be created.</p> <p>For time to exist there must be “change of position of particles in space”.

I agree anything that cannot be objectively verified or analysed is a belief, however I believe that most of the technology in Scientology and especially Dianetics can be verified by anyone who can analyse these things objectively.</p> <p>One might believe a saw can cut wood but there is nothing to compare with actually cutting a piece of wood with one, at which time the properties of a saw become a demonstrable fact.  However that does not mean said saw can cut every material, but that in no way invalidates the usefulness of a saw.</p> <p>I have subjective reality that these Scientology tools work, and without them I would struggle to run my business.  These tools when understood and used IN LOVE produce miraculous results but used without love (THETA) can be exceedingly destructive.</p> <p>Love with Understanding<br /> Pip</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329538"> 		<div id="comment-329538"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a1049d2528a46f6bd92dca4577fd768f?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://www.unicef.org/' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Cat Daddy</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329538"> 				February 5, 2015 at 4:58 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329538#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329538", "329538", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Cat Daddy'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I know they work.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-christianscientology odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329637"> 		<div id="comment-329637"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/535874aa14b2cef0c4574543b07e8463?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">christianscientology</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329637"> 				February 6, 2015 at 11:40 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329637#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329637", "329637", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to christianscientology'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Good!</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even thread-even depth-1 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329493"> 		<div id="comment-329493"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/49ed3747454eb55c10f4beccdb4fd4f6?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comments' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Conan</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329493"> 				February 5, 2015 at 12:23 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329493#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329493", "329493", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Conan'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hi Marty,</p> <p>Good writing, I think it is a good ending for this lunacy.</p> <p> I recommend Edward Gibbon’s book “The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire: Abridge Edition”, particularly Chapter XV “The Progress of the Christian religion, and the Sentiments, Manners, Numbers, and Condition, of the primitive Christians.”</p> <p>The chapter is hilarious, written with Gibbon’s wit and humor.

Jesus was not a CHRISTIAN in fact, the rulers of the synagogues saw him as a heretic in Jewish terms. JESUS DID NOT COME TO START A NEW RELIGION, HE CAME TO RESTORE A RELATIONSHIP, FIRST WITH OUR MAKER AND THEN WITH OUR BROTHERS.</p> <p>Christian was not a name the followers of Jesus called themselves, this was a term of derision used by NONE-BELIEVERS (Acts 11:26), believers called themselves “Followers of the way” (Acts 9:2) Constantine historically was the first person to call himself “A CHRISTIAN” not because he followed Jesus but for political expedience.  I would argue that in fact Constantine was the first Christian and it was him and his followers that instigated Churchianity.  One only has to look at the number of schisms in Christianity to see how EXCLUSIVE it is.</p> <p>Jesus Christ is both totally inclusive and totally exclusive for his teachings are the ultimate paradox.  While inviting everyone to come to him at the same time He affirms that He is the only way, “Jesus said to him, &#8220;I am the way, and the truth, and the life; …….” John 14:6 NASB.

And no, I haven&#8217;t been talking the usual line that the Church of Scientology does not equal Freezone/Independent Scientology, either.</p> <p>I only have respect and feel close to people like Anonymous because they indeed challenge suppression and oppression, and among other things, they are among the few people who instead of parroting the usual press lines about Greece (how we are all lazy etc) they viewed a different angle. An angle that I have observed too.</p> <p>People who represent suppressive religions and corporations who have been jolly well making profit out of the slave labor and brainwashing of others, are not my friends just because they attack the suppression and oppression within Scientology. Their talk is just disturbing to me, and means nothing more, as they talk about their beliefs or asserted beliefs and nothing that they personally know. Few are those who had experiences from inside, and not all of them say the same. And I don&#8217;t buy hypnotic suggestions such as &#8216;Satanism&#8217; and implied calls for crusades. You call for fanaticism. What do you have against then fanaticism of Scientology, then? </p> <p>This stoning and online court case calls for punishment. And I&#8217;m not interested in it. I would interested to discuss stuff like how to make things better. If you think that the deeds of some should deny the right of Scientologists to not have their pride and freedom to think and practice what they want, you are no better than what you supposedly fight against. You are indeed very arrogant and fanatic to think that you know &#8216;the right thing&#8217;, which would be a &#8216;right belief&#8217;.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t want Scientology either. So what? Is it my call? Should I lie and scare people about it so as to make it disappear? Should I seek for people to get punished? If I did that for each and every group I deem destructive, I would be doing nothing else. I rest my case.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329522"> 		<div id="comment-329522"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/350d54331c090bcdace0f231815a0dd3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">marildi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329522"> 				February 5, 2015 at 3:19 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329522#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329522", "329522", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to marildi'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Spyros, I admire your integrity.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-spyrosillusionist even depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329583"> 		<div id="comment-329583"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1e3a3898eb06ac9bec55d9581e9d1dd4?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://spyrosillusionist.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Spyros</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329583"> 				February 5, 2015 at 10:32 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329583#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329583", "329583", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Spyros'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>If I expected to hear that from somebody, that was you, M.

Seeking to get people punished is different than fighting back.  There is a wide difference.  You have made several accusations here about denying people freedom or having the purpose to deny people freedom. Yet you enjoy the freedom of joining in on this conversation. A freedom Marty created for you. </p> <p>As far as Freezoners and Indepenents, several people have alluded to them lately as being concerned parties.</p> <p>The Freezoners have never been involved in this noise, they could not care less about these conversations. Attempting them into this theater has been a waste of time. One fanatic OSA plant tried desperately to create a civil war between the Freezoners and Independents and just wore his stubby fingers out on his keyboard.</p> <p>There are only three people in the Independent Movement attacking. Hardly a casting call in this theater.</p> <p>Then there are people like you, that think any conversation about Scientology = hostility. This is not a hate site. Marty has never been anti anything except domestic abuse and domestic terrorism and corruption.<br /> I have no idea why a FEW people A=A this blog with other blogs or web sites.

Actually, I&#8217;ve spent much more time clarifying stuff than saying anything new. You can&#8217;t say anything against SCN and you&#8217;re SP, and you can&#8217;t say anything pro-SCN and you&#8217;re brainwashed, and so on. I know how it goes.</p> <p>Generally speaking, I don&#8217;t quite get how the things you wrote about me connect to what I said before, nor before that.</p> <p>I have been reading anti-SCN stuff since before I got involved with SCN itself, and even after that, and I don&#8217;t see how much of that is related to SCN, either. </p> <p>I think freedom is not a nice excuse to smear-talk others in public and cause outrage against them. It would be something to take some freaking LRH text and analyse it, and another things to compare SCN with satanism and jihad and other stuff. One might bring about understanding, the other create impressions. Do you know the difference? The difference is similar to having a chat with somebody or having that somebody im-press his boot on your face, so you will get impressed.</p> <p>Most of the time I let people be hostile or whatever they are, whether I like it or not.

So, he approached me and with an intimidative look told me &#8216;I know what that thing is about&#8230;you will not proselytize anyone in here.&#8217; I never intended to &#8216;proselytize&#8217; anybody, but it was something between tragic and funny to be told that by him in specific, as in school, I was being proselytised since 5 years old. I was forced to say my prayers, and learn and write good exams or else&#8230;(bad things would happen to me). So, from that alone, Christianity 1 Scientology 0. </p> <p>My point is regardless of outrageous or not beliefs, people should be free to believe&#8230;or not. I shouldn&#8217;t be afraid to become a Wiccan nor a Thelemite, if in the future I decide to do so &#8211;so that others wont boo-boo at me. I don&#8217;t give anybody the right to impose nor hinder any beliefs upon me. </p> <p>I&#8217;m glad some nasty practices get known so that people wont fall victims to them. I&#8217;m not glad to create dicrimination. I could have some #$#% to talk about some beliefs too, you know. Generally, I find it funny to hear by christians how &#8216;crazy&#8217; SCN is. Because a psychiatrist would be glad to hear from them how nice it is to chat with an old man in the heavens before they go to sleep every night.</p> <p>This is not personal about Marty. You misunderstood. But if I understood that Marty became like that then OK, I would let you all be. I just can&#8217;t fake it, and shit PR and pretend this would be OK with me.

Yeah, confusion, duplication, understanding, realization, judgment.  I love it, REALLY great and highly applicable LRH lecture.  UNFORTUNATELY, my observation of people in the CoS is that they almost NEVER came out of duplication (which seemed to be the main challenge for them).  Of course, ACTUALLY spending the time to truly understand and work through to realization would &#8220;slow&#8221; one down in the eyes of the robotic supes and product officers, so folks very rarely got there.  The best auditors and CSs did.   Judgement?   Ha ha ha ha &#8230; PLEASE!  Using your judgement and not just &#8220;following orders&#8221; and complying in the church of scientology?  You&#8217;re kidding, right?  That&#8217;s what Ron wrought by insisting on obedience to &#8220;source&#8221; and the datum that YOU always had it wrong if you questioned his authority.

I&#8217;m not very mean &#8211;only temporarily, sometimes. </p> <p>I could come here and be nice with everybody, but I chose to be a little rude. I don&#8217;t know why I do it. I thought being nice while everybody else is rude is a bit too peaceful. Blame my fileclerk, for making me think so. </p> <p>I&#8217;m not with anybody. I&#8217;m with honest people, and I want freedom for all. A kind of freedom that wont be used to reduce the freedom of others. </p> <p>And I don&#8217;t think &#8216;do what you will&#8217; cancels ethics, because I think will (what thelemites call &#8216;true will&#8217;) and ethics go together. And people don&#8217;t need another to point that out to them. I don&#8217;t believe in imposing ethics.</p> <p>And I don&#8217;t feel at all victimised by that bashing at SCN. One because i&#8217;m not a SCNists. Two because I partially agree &#8211;but only partially. I just talk to talk. </p> <p>Hey, truth be told folks, I think SCN is some crazed sci fi thing, and magic like you said, and unrealistic, and I have no prob with that, to be honest. I have prob with some suppression involved with it. I think all religions and spiritualities have the &#8216;crazy&#8217; factor involved more or less. And I&#8217;m cool with it, because I don&#8217;t believe in psychiatry.</p> <p>I too think that to be cool with dumping your body is cool, in SCN. But it doesn&#8217;t mean suicide to me. Suicide is more like quiting, where dumping would be more like not feeling bad about it, because the body is their possession and not them, as spirits. I wouldn&#8217;t use that to justify coaxing another to die, though. Nor would I want a beloved person to me to die, nor others.  I&#8217;m sorry if it&#8217;s been used like that. And you have to admit SCNists usually look younger than the average &#8211;it must be because of the contracts with the devil.</p> <p>Anyway, I wish you all well. I&#8217;m not too serious about what I said. I just talked to talk.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire even depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329615"> 		<div id="comment-329615"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329615"> 				February 6, 2015 at 7:50 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329615#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329615", "329615", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>When a person is interiorized into &#8220;I&#8221; he may think he is free, but he is getting more and more confined into &#8220;I&#8221;.</p> <p>He is all the time using his &#8220;I&#8221; as the reference point to judge everything around him.</p> <p>He is just going around in circles.

You have found a place within this conversation where you belong.  My viewpoint is that if Marty writes something new, or you read something anywhere on the Internet that is a conversation going on, if you FEEL, FEEL something, you belong somewhere in that conversation.  Because the WORDS have conjured something up in you that wants or needs to be heard. </p> <p>So, if you read something, and the thoughts and words begin to flow, it concerns you in some way.</p> <p>On the Internet forums there are no obligations to anyone so I don&#8217;t think there is a lot of PR going on. </p> <p>I can see it is very disturbing to some people when they feel they have been privy to a secret society, that has been groomed in close conspiracies, when the curtain is drawn back and suddenly, the world can be included.  From the beginning I felt that Marty&#8217;s actions were bringing the Scientology down on to the streets.  David Miscavige has been burying it tombs.  The only way for it to bloom and grow, whatever is to be used, is to put it out on the streets.</p> <p>There is a condescending view amongst the Scientology community that &#8220;street people&#8221; or &#8220;wogs&#8221; can&#8217;t handle the ideas.  That one must have some spiritual supremacy and entitlement for these ideas. And mainly, one must be paid up in taxes to Int Management and registered as a member to know.</p> <p>When Hubbard wrote most of his ideas down, birth control pills were considered taboo.  This is not the same society.</p> <p>Marty gets attacked over and over and over and it is always for the same reason. He is bringing it out onto the street and he is INCLUDING others.</p> <p>Someone, had to grow some courage and do SOMETHING.  Because under David Miscavige, burying it all in vaults and paying people like mad to keep their mouths shut and working madly to bury the TRUTH in the shadows, this Scientology subject was DYING.</p> <p>Hubbard made huge headway with the subject of psychometry that will matter greatly as time moved forward.</p> <p>Marty chooses not to devalue and underestimate his fellow man or run the &#8220;spiritual supremacy&#8221; ser fac on people.  I think it is a good thing and if people had more faith in their fellow man and less concern about the economics involved with their secret societies, exclusive groups, and spiritual supremacy, the world would be a better place.</p> <p>That people take some of their faith and place it in people outside of the Church, has been taboo for too long.  The Nation of Islam is flying with Dianetics.  Bring it on down to the streets. Have a little faith in the street people.</p> <p>That is what I see right about Marty.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-5 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329643"> 		<div id="comment-329643"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62094ea8485520b990be9f9d0dd38dd2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">TheOracle</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329643"> 				February 6, 2015 at 12:14 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329643#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329643", "329643", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to TheOracle'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>And I do not take the obsessive efforts of a few street people who work 24/7 to reduce Hubbard&#8217;s ideas and life, and all of the curious who explored Scientology or the supernatural, into a minus value, as an index of everybody down on the streets.</p> <p>I have never gone into agreement that I should feel or be ashamed of myself or others, for being curious.

And I try to be like that too.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t know how much you know/remember from what I have written. I am even more out of agreement with people than Marty, but I&#8217;m not popular and I don&#8217;t matter to the FZ nor the COS nor the anti-SCN people. In this trio I take no part, but I acknowledge the existence of good people in all sides. Plus, the &#8216;bad&#8217; thing about me is I disagree with things said about SCN as theory, as I have a different understanding about it. I think it&#8217;s better than usually said. But regardless of that, I too have thought that the way I have witnessed SCN, it would better off gone. In present time, I don&#8217;t really know. I leave it to each one to decide for himself. I don&#8217;t think it is my call to decide what each person should do, I think so, because not all view SCN to be the same thing.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t believe in any spiritual supremacy, nor any imposed ethics from the ethical ones towards the unethical ones.  I also think we all are -in our core- at the end of any possible spiritual path. All we have to do is realize it. </p> <p>I like Hubbard&#8217;s texts, though I don&#8217;t and wont audit.  I wont fight for them, either. He doesn&#8217;t fight them either. I don&#8217;t attribute all that has happened in the name of Scientology to him, either. </p> <p>Well, in any case, no matter what happens to SCN, it will be what is decided by it&#8217;s people.  It is kept alive due to some good people. And good people can do good SCN or not. I&#8217;m cool whatever happens, because I don&#8217;t think it is the only possible way. But Scientologists and all others should have the right to believe and practice &#8211;without harming others. And the ill-intended guys&#8230;I wouldn&#8217;t fight them either, because fighting perpetuates conditions, it doesn&#8217;t resolve them. Love, truth, assistance solve much better. I could have a hard time, or temporarily get a little harsh but, I never fall in apathy about solutions.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-6 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329736"> 		<div id="comment-329736"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62094ea8485520b990be9f9d0dd38dd2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">TheOracle</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329736"> 				February 7, 2015 at 2:38 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329736#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329736", "329736", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to TheOracle'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I do remember much of what you have written. I have always been appreciative of your thoughts.  I like the &#8220;middle road&#8221; and it&#8217;s calm winds myself.  On the middle road, it is only important for me personally not to run can&#8217;t haves or must have&#8217;s on others. Because these are things I do not tolerate very well when run on me. Mostly, I do  not want to run &#8220;can&#8217;t have ideas&#8221; on others. Unless those ideas lead to harming others.</p> <p>In a perfect world for me, Scientology would just be a bookstore outlet. Where people could go to buy the books or course packs.  Co audit in small groups and have meet ups in people&#8217;s living rooms. It would just be about that, people having interesting conversations with one another.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t like the ethics and justice system because it presumes people do not have an ethics system of their own. Or the one they have is not workable. I had my own code of ethics when I came in and it worked for me. I wasn&#8217;t interested in switching over. I haven&#8217;t met many people on this earth that don&#8217;t have a code of ethics. Maybe I never met anyone that didn&#8217;t have a code of ethics, even if it was unique.  These things have to be arranged by a person them self. </p> <p>I didn&#8217;t make many friends in Scientology because I knew those friendships were very fragile and highly conditional. At the end of the day what was the value for me? The conversations I had with the auditors.  Those were very magical.</p> <p>I still see the entire essence of the experience as exploring magic. But I have never met anyone involved that sees it like that.  I never had a group or friends to loose in reality.  I was encouraged to have enemies I did not want. I declined. Got labeled &#8220;reasonable&#8221;. I took it as a compliment.  Nobody wanted to burden me with any real responsibility because I was a &#8220;defective&#8221; thetan. I love to reason.  It&#8217;s a habit.</p> <p>I try to smooth out some of the conflict with a &#8220;spoon full of sugar&#8221; from time to time.  That annoys some of the soldiers.</p> <p>Handling danger situations is not beneath me though. And one only needs to watch the videos and read the testimony, and sometimes, just be at my house, to see that David Miscavige and his Central Intelligence Agency makes themselves a danger situation people are forced to deal with.  If they stopped being a danger in this society, they wouldn&#8217;t have any problems being &#8220;supreme beings&#8221;.</p> <p>I think it can be sorted out with out blood shed.  Marty has been brilliant at handling these forces and conditions. He had a duty to himself and his family to handle the danger situations the Church has become to him. And so do I.  I can support this from a distance because I do not possess the calm needed to stand in the middle of the storm. Like, the guy that was doing those depositions? I would have jumped across the table and started choking him.  I know my weakness&#8217;.   That is why I stay on the middle road.  And on the far left and far right, I see people consumed by their weakness.  And it&#8217;s scary.</p> <p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vLkp_Dx6VdI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-7 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329741"> 		<div id="comment-329741"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62094ea8485520b990be9f9d0dd38dd2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">TheOracle</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329741"> 				February 7, 2015 at 3:06 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329741#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329741", "329741", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to TheOracle'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>By the way, I know annoys some people that I don&#8217;t have any regrets.

It depends on how you deal with it each time. I have swung from side to side, from time to time, but it doesn&#8217;t feel good to me to act against any part of life. So, I don&#8217;t have it last for long. I understand and agree with the concept of not submitting to suppression, but at some point, if the suppression was 20 years ago, that game should end. If a condition exists in present time, it is different. I&#8217;m not always calm if I have some hostility occurring in PT and I don&#8217;t like to turn cheeks, either.</p> <p>You said &#8220;Mostly, I do not want to run &#8220;can&#8217;t have ideas&#8221; on others. Unless those ideas lead to harming others.&#8221; That was my argument, exactly. A can&#8217;t have, can&#8217;t do, be Scientology, is a can&#8217;t too. People should be free to choose. I&#8217;ve heard (mostly through that documentary) how harsh the German government has been on Scientologists, and that shouldn&#8217;t occur. Here the government hasn&#8217;t interfered as much, but the press has made it so one would feel ashamed to say that he is a Scientologist. If we started to count crimes and sins, very few to no groups should any longer exist.</p> <p>The worst thing about ethics in SCN and in general, is when you have an unethical person &#8216;put ethics&#8217; on you. That drove me to self-invalidation. And I&#8217;ve noticed it is usually unethical people that get obsessed with forcing ethics upon others.</p> <p>What you said about Scientology fragile friendships had been a big heartbreak for me. To have a whole bunch of people think ill of you, or even disconnect, because some %#$%%## told them so&#8230;not nice. I think it is the major reason why Scientology gets pounded so hard by former members. Some could realize that, and save themselves. Alas, no sense of self criticism. </p> <p>So, you have trouble with DM? You must be kinda like a vip. Fortunately, I&#8217;m not. It takes some nerve to be under pressure, and not hate the subject as a whole.</p> <p>For me, magic is included in SCN theory in the sense of making things happen by non physical means &#8211;but directly, as spirit. There is no mysticism that I know. One would wonder, &#8216;If you can make things happen, as spirit, how come you run onto such trouble? What sort of power is this?&#8217;. I laugh at this contradiction. Well, it is up to anyone to discover, whether power exists or whether we bring trouble upon ourselves through our own power, as said in SCN. I for sure don&#8217;t think of power, as a way to cause harm, for starters. I think mean people are also weak, that&#8217;s why they try so hard to convince others of their power. The domination of evil exists only as a delusion. Sadly, commonly shared delusions can be called reality.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-8 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329785"> 		<div id="comment-329785"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62094ea8485520b990be9f9d0dd38dd2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">TheOracle</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329785"> 				February 7, 2015 at 10:11 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329785#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329785", "329785", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to TheOracle'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Wow!  This blew so much anger for me!</p> <p>&#8220;The worst thing about ethics in SCN and in general, is when you have an unethical person ‘put ethics’ on you. That drove me to self-invalidation. And I’ve noticed it is usually unethical people that get obsessed with forcing ethics upon others.&#8221;</p> <p>The thing is,making the best choices.  That is how it&#8217;s described anyway.<br /> It used to come up on sec checks. O.K. like I stole money for food frequently growing up. Only until I knew I could panhandle (beg on the street).  It wasn&#8217;t a lot that I stole. Change out of the bottom of people&#8217;s pocket books,only to buy something very small. One time I got real criminal and greedy and took paper money and splurged,went to a Chinese restaurant like a big shot. That was the only time I got caught and,the only time someone noticed some money was missing!!!  That is how little and infrequently I did this. So, this comes up in auditing.  And the up shot is that,you know, I&#8217;m a criminal on some level. &#8220;Financial irregs&#8221; on my history.</p> <p>Well, what choices did I have then?  I was a very smart kid,skipped two grades ahead in school, I knew a lot about making the best choices.  It was the best choice.  The other choice was to starve, and I was so thin and ate so infrequently that that was a real possibility. Is stealing always an overt or an indication of criminal intention? No.  What kind of choice is it to starve?  I would have worked gladly.  And finally did get a job when I was 12, cleaning out pet store cages and selling out dated newspapers. I didn&#8217;t want to steal or beg.</p> <p>And the thing I have about these sec checks and the ethics, is that nobody ever asks how what you did was the best choice.  They never look for rightness. They never even ask. THEY ADD IT UP FOR YOU. They decide you didn&#8217;t make the best choice,and never ask what the choices were.  Don&#8217;t you think common sense would prevail?  They do the math and they don&#8217;t know the equations!</p> <p>Once I was late for a session at an org. Got sent to ethics. Told if I was later again I would be put in liability. I was the only P.C. that Org had at that time. How the hell could I be a liability even if I was late every night? What about the fact that I was showing up at all and trying to improve? I got mad and walked out the front door. The entire staff came running after me,my auditor finally catching up to me and convincing me to come back. Last time I ever got sent to ethics. I said it. I made them admit I was not a liability. Not even close.</p> <p>I knew about the fragile friendships before I ever took a course. Because my mother who I was visiting, kicked me out on the streets when I was 14 because I said something negative about Scientology.  I didn&#8217;tknow what she was up to,asked a neighbor. He said Scientology was a crutch and I relayed the message.  So, I never trusted a Scientologist.  Except the auditors.  But you have to have a line in the sand there too. It has to be a two way conversation. I haven&#8217;t been afraid to stop a process. I haven&#8217;t been afraid to end the conversation on my terms and when I want to.  I didn&#8217;t like the one way rights. The auditor ends the session and all that. I cut a few auditors off,O.K.more than a few.  Not forever or in a bad way, just, &#8220;This session is over if this is the way it&#8217;s going to be.&#8221;  And they ended to tell the C/S.</p> <p>I really did like the other people that were involved in Scientology for the most part.  But I knew they were Hubbard&#8217;s friends,not mine.  It&#8217;s like going to a party. You don&#8217;t ask the guests to come over to your house to continue the party.  I wasn&#8217;t eager to bring any of my friends into Scientology, because I knew that an unconditional friendship could turn into a conditional one by them becoming one. My friends never bothered me about my involvement, I didn&#8217;t burden them with it either or try to push it on them. I may have gotten a little teased in good natured ways. </p> <p>All in all, it was pretty interesting. It still is when I am getting auditing out here.  Friendships in the independent movement have been very solid.</p> <p>I think it attracts some very interesting people. I love the conversations on the table.  Even if I do not originate them. If I originated them, I would really be considered weird.</p> <p>Sorry about the eval on your file clerk. I was just kidding you. I made my file clerk do the anti Q and A Drills.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-9 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329788"> 		<div id="comment-329788"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62094ea8485520b990be9f9d0dd38dd2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">TheOracle</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329788"> 				February 7, 2015 at 10:25 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329788#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329788", "329788", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to TheOracle'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>(Just kidding you)</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-spyrosillusionist odd alt depth-9 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329798"> 		<div id="comment-329798"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1e3a3898eb06ac9bec55d9581e9d1dd4?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://spyrosillusionist.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Spyros</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329798"> 				February 8, 2015 at 12:32 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329798#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329798", "329798", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Spyros'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hehe I didn&#8217;t mind the file clerk thing. I just didn&#8217;t get the joke, and I don&#8217;t think I have any file clerk.</p> <p>&#8220;How the hell could I be a liability even if I was late every night? &#8221; Do you mean you were late to go home at night and thus you were assigned a liability condition? That&#8217;s too lol for words.</p> <p>My view of ethics is that -like you said- it is inherent to beings. And a being is aware of ethics the more it is aware of itself as it&#8217;s original being, and doesn&#8217;t identify with other things and thus doesn&#8217;t get brainwashed either (one brings another). Thus actual self determinism is ethical.  Thus a self determined being doesn&#8217;t harm &#8211;at least not more than it assists life. It goes along with what I said before about power. And the more self determined a being is, the more it allows self determinism in others, too. So yeah, be free and let be free.</p> <p>On the contrary, people on a constant overt mode, with no sense of self criticism, see in others what they themselves do, and seek to stop others instead of themselves. For them freedom means chaos, destruction, for that&#8217;s what they would do if they were free. And they cannot allow that.</p> <p>For me the handling is to let them be too, like the rest. Just don&#8217;t play their game.</p> <p>I have met nice people everywhere. I don&#8217;t think there is any rule that the good ones go here and the bad ones go there.  </p> <p>I have long decided to not be involved with SCN because I think something is amiss. Simply put, by studying SCN I got different ideas how it would be like, than it was.  it is good to get rid of some charge, of course. I just don&#8217;t think Hubbard set any goals like &#8216;to handle the 4th dynamic so we can then handle ourselves.&#8217; That&#8217;s blame, and quite opposite to what I&#8217;ve read. If you&#8217;re in trouble, you should handle your creating it, not others creating it, as per SCN. Trouble is not natural for a being, according to theory. Thus, I think all trouble can be handled, and fighting is not only unnecessary, but it is a form of trouble itself. </p> <p>I cannot speak on behalf of Hubbard, I only try to make logical sense out of what I&#8217;ve read in conjunction with my own experiences. He is very well responsible for my knowing I&#8217;m not just a body and I&#8217;m very grateful for that. And the outpoints I have noticed in SCN are due to his own theories, as well. From then on, i try to deal with my stuff by myself, the way I see best.<br />  <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329840"> 		<div id="comment-329840"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62094ea8485520b990be9f9d0dd38dd2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">TheOracle</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329840"> 				February 8, 2015 at 12:52 pm</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>I can&#8217;t speak on behalf of anybody.

More entertaining?  It was different. It was worth my time. All of my relationships have been.

When they get busted and called on the carpet, they scream that the religion and the Church are being attacked. They work to pull everyone in as the targets, when they are not.  This is how they re stimulate people and use them.</p> <p>Once they can be made aware that they are NOT the targets, (for me anyway), they can be separated out.  There are people out here that are targeting every Scientologist, every Church of Scientology, and every idea Hubbard ever had.  And this is PROOF that everyone and their life and community is under attack and David thrives on this because it gives him cover. But this is a minority.  Most of us do not have animosity towards everybody there and we are not trying to set them up for a loss or run any can&#8217;t have on them. Or even take something away from them. Miscavige frightens them into think they are all being attacked,and they group around him.

The hate is mostly addressed towards some practices that almost anyone would deem to be messed up. But in the process of fighting people tend to generalize, often on purpose, like myself, as I don&#8217;t want to accuse anybody specific in public. And so they go like &#8220;Scientologists are crazy&#8221; etc. I too have said really mean stuff about &#8216;Scientology&#8217; but I had specific things in mind that were indeed really mean. I wouldn&#8217;t do nor recommend to anyone to do that stuff (I have written what that &#8216;stuff&#8217; are, from time to time), of course. But if me or another condemned all &#8216;Scientology&#8217;, he would also condemn much Buddhism, as well as other things that are alligned with Buddhism, and those things are not few. I think what makes Scientology special is it&#8217;s practice -auditing- and the e-meter. Space opera sounds new, but it&#8217;s not completely. It&#8217;s just that the ancient scripts that talk about strange things in the sky, and strange looking creatures, didn&#8217;t use terms such as &#8216;space opera&#8217;, &#8216;aliens&#8217; etc. </p> <p>It is odd that in Scientology there is the concept of the &#8216;third party&#8217; (third party=a person that secretly incites fighting), and is seen as the root of all war, and there is an implication that war is uneccesary and stupid and that fighters are used. I say it is odd, because -based on that- I don&#8217;t see what reasoning one has, if he fights FOR Scientology. As per the text, one should automatically search for a HIDDEN, UNKNOWN third party, if he felt like being drawn into a fight.</p> <p>I do believe it too, that from the division of Scientologists, and critics too, only few could benefit. I can imagine, if somebody wanted to create a sect -to keep people secluded, and in the dark- would benefit from such a war. Those who wouldn&#8217;t want some communications to flow freely. So, they would make communication so painful (fighting) so that people wouldn&#8217;t communicate. I suggest people shouldn&#8217;t play along, and they should take care of each other more, and not divide.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-6 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330052"> 		<div id="comment-330052"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/350d54331c090bcdace0f231815a0dd3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">marildi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330052"> 				February 12, 2015 at 4:37 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330052#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330052", "330052", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to marildi'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hey Spyros &#8211; you amaze me sometimes. What you wrote is very close to what LRH was saying back in 1955: </p> <p>“…the arduous lesson along this line is that no-communication lists, revocation/suspension of certificates, court action of any kind whatsoever within the realm of Scientology and so forth, is not only…not only difficult to do but does not work. That’s just the end of it. It just doesn’t work. It’s for the sea gulls.</p> <p>“That might work in Gestetner Limited or Westinghouse, but it does not work in Scientology. Got that?</p> <p>“It’s because they are people of good intention. And by saying that these people are not fit to associate with us anymore, we have told a lie of magnitude. This is not true. It’s never true. You got it?</p> <p>“OUR INABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE ACTIONS OF OTHER SCIENTOLOGISTS HAS A VERY FASCINATING BARRIER. THE LIMITATION ON OUR UNDERSTANDING IS SIMPLY THIS: WE SAY THEY HAVE BAD INTENTIONS, AND THAT IS A LIE. Got it?</p> <p>“So the whole situation is liable to enturbulate around that postulated bad intention. That’s what enturbulates the situation. That makes a lie. The situation then becomes unsolvable. Because we’ve entered a changing factor called a lie into it.</p> <p>“The most valuable asset we have, actually, is our ability to understand, to do the right thing, to be kind, to be decent.</p> <p>“WELL, I HATE TO UNSETTLE A VERY STABLE DATUM, IF IT DOES UNSETTLE IT. BUT THE ONLY WAY ANYTHING EVER DOES RESOLVE IS BY LETTING YOUR OWN KIND HEART REACH THROUGH. THAT’S THE ONLY WAY IT EVER DOES SOLVE. AND IT NEVER SOLVES BY BEING TOUGH.</p> <p>“What do we really have of value in the organizations of Scientology? The only thing we have of value, actually, is Scientology, an understanding of life, increasing ability to communicate, a good concept and grip on reality and the ability to like guys. That’s all you got.</p> <p>“And there’s only one more thing that we could know that would make us all feel very, very relaxed about the whole thing. There isn’t a person anywhere in Scientology who has bad intentions for Scientologists or their fellow man. And that point all by itself is very well worth thinking about the next time some trouble arises in your vicinity, because that is the truth. And if you handle a situation with that in mind, you will solve the situation.”</p> <p>(&#8220;Attitude and Conduct of Scientology”, 4th London ACC, 3rd November 1955)</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-martyrathbun09 comment-author-is-site-member bypostauthor even depth-7 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330072"> 		<div id="comment-330072"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c2d94d163a566268e73c8b0195b6c03a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Mark C.

These aren&#8217;t core beliefs at all, and to say that they are is just sloppy thinking and I am surprised to see you thinking that way. </p> <p>Your points are not the core beliefs of Scientology; they are the peripheral delusions of L. Ron Hubbard and many of them were slipped into the bulletins and policy letters and lectures and there have been SOME who believed them &#8211; not many, but some. </p> <p>There have never been millions of Scientologists, but I&#8217;d bet that there have been some hundreds of thousands who at one time or another proudly considered themselves to be Scientologists or Dianeticists and yet had subscribed to little or none of these &#8220;core beliefs&#8221;. </p> <p>The things you are calling the core beliefs of Scientology were never the core beliefs of most of the people who have directly benefited from Scientology. These are the beliefs of some staff members and some Sea Org members and the most zealous of public. But that&#8217;s a minority of the people who have been or are involved. </p> <p>What&#8217;s the average tenure of a staff member? It is much less than two and a half years &#8211; very few complete a contract. What&#8217;s the average tenure of a Sea Org member? I don&#8217;t think much longer. You accept that sort of thinking when you are in as it&#8217;s part of the battle-cry and part of the game the way Ron had it mocked up. Ron admits to needing enemies. There&#8217;s at least one place where he admits to it being his decision to make the psychs the bad guys. We all had to band together to fight to coalesce the group. It&#8217;s like the sci fi stories of all the nations of earth getting their shit together to beat the mean martians.</p> <p>But once you leave staff, you don&#8217;t have to put up with that harangue anymore. When you leave Truman&#8217;s World and you realize it, you know longer have to act like Jim Carey. </p> <p>What percentage of people who get involved finally arrive onto OT 3? Very small. What&#8217;s the percentage of OT 3s who quit very soon after? I understand it&#8217;s pretty high. People blow off those levels as Ron&#8217;s Sci Fi explanation of the problems of the universe just doesn&#8217;t make for very good reasoning. It&#8217;s hard to stomach as a &#8220;right why&#8221; for the travails of Man. </p> <p>I think most Scientologists when we knew of these beliefs did not buy into them. Maybe the psychiatrist one a bit, as there certainly was evidence that these people certainly had a bloody history. </p> <p>Yes, they cheer as long as they are in and nod their heads in agreement, but once they are out, these ideas you have mentioned, if they were ever believed are soon jettisoned as they just don&#8217;t make sense.  Believing in such things when you are not on staff is just not a component in building a better life. </p> <p>You have done a good job of identifying LRH&#8217;s fantastically ridiculous notions about the world that he did his best to get people to accept as true. But this particular bit of hypnotism was not successful to most Scientologists. To label them as &#8220;core beliefs&#8221;: just not so. </p> <p>These might be considered the core beliefs of the most nutty people in Scientology, or of many Scientologists when they were at their most nutty, but these are not the core beliefs of Scientology or most Scientologists. </p> <p>Henry Ford did much to advance the technology of management. He also had a lot of screwball notions, not about psychs, but pretty much the same sort of thinking about Jews. In Spring 1920, Ford made his personal newspaper, The Dearborn Independent, chronicle what he considered the &#8220;Jewish menace&#8221;. Every week for 91 issues, the paper exposed some sort of Jewish-inspired evil major story in a headline. </p> <p>Undoubtedly lots of people believed just as he did and cheered him on. But there were also thousands if not millions who said, &#8220;Makes a great car, but what a creep!&#8221;</p> <p>You can&#8217;t truthfully say that Ford&#8217;s perverse view of the world made his management technology looney. People in his camp were able to differentiate. The same is true with many Scientologists.</p> <p>The true core beliefs for most people who have ever been Scientologists are truly the Scientology Zero materials and the Creed and the Aims. Yes, pretty much all the things grandma would agree to if they were well explained. These are the true core beliefs. </p> <p>The things you mentioned aren&#8217;t core; they are strategies that LRH put into place to frighten people into compliance, and, being that they were in direct opposition to the core things that were taught that really did align with &#8220;the combined truths of fifty thousand years of thinking men&#8221;, they never worked very well for very long. </p> <p>Every time one reads about the &#8220;good old days&#8221; of Scientology, they are talking about their times in a mission or org where ARC and the best things of life were the way the game was played.  Truly there are many of us who will indeed carry the points of view given in &#8220;Attitude and Conduct of Scientologists&#8221; to our graves.</p> <p>And wherever did you get the information where you could say &#8220;<i><b>In fact</b></i> scientology never achieved even the scientifically recognized 20 to 30 percent placebo effect in terms of long-term satisfaction.&#8221;? I am very curious about what data you or someone has that brought about that conclusion. I venture to say that there are no actual facts that back up that conclusion, or that these &#8220;facts&#8221; were advanced by a very prejudiced individual.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-martyrathbun09 comment-author-is-site-member bypostauthor even depth-9 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330451"> 		<div id="comment-330451"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c2d94d163a566268e73c8b0195b6c03a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Mark C.

I think TRs are good Div 6 stuff, and drills for auditors. But they could as well be nicely used in psychology &#8211;the way I have done those TRs. And they are not spirituality. Particularly, this not reacting thing, this poker face,  is well taught in psychosciences too, and is considered a desirable EP. Like Hubbard wrote in the book about the purif RD &#8216;We used to have men made of iron and ships men of wood and now we have ships made of iron and men made of wood&#8217;. I don&#8217;t like TRs and the fixation on body PT. TRs so as to go through difficulties in communicating, yes. TRs to make you wood, no. Before you tell me how Hubbard wrote about robotic TRs and premature acks, I know about it. And may I also tell you how I have mostly witnessed that, and not anything else, and how TRs ARC broke me constantly, because they seemed fake to me, and I didn&#8217;t feel I communicated at all. Of course it was my fault because &#8216;I had too many witholds&#8217;. Bah. How come I no longer ARC break? Maybe I had something with SCN eh? Nope. the SCN group had something with itself. The other fixation on flow 1 omits the other 3 flows, and it&#8217;s done on purpose to implant guilts, by the way. Nobody questions the group. It&#8217;s all your fault mehehe. Guess what, that&#8217;s blame from the group to the person too! </p> <p>Yes, I watched the video, but I&#8217;m still not sure whether he has something in mind like the TRs I mentioned, or something else. Obama projects the iimage Tolle says, indeed. Who knows what goes on  inside him? A capable person could project about anything. I&#8217;m not implying anything. I just don&#8217;t know Obama.

I’ll say this, however – even many critics still consider the TRs to be of value. I would add to that &#8211; IF they were supervised correctly on them.

The most important point I have explained, is that TRs are &#8216;too much body&#8217;, the way I see them. They are communication drills, not meditation. I don&#8217;t see how they relate to what I said about attempts to get me bullied. There is more, for me, than dealing more efficiently with a problem, and that is not having it. And the &#8216;handle or disconnect&#8217; is a choice similar to &#8216;get a job or not&#8217;, if you don&#8217;t control who you communicate with at your job. Of course, I only talk whenever and with whomever I want to, whenever I think I have a choice. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether I think &#8216;SP&#8217; or not.</p> <p>I can imagine TRs and other things being used in a self determined manner. But I didn&#8217;t take it there in the first place &#8211;whether LRH meant them to be like that or not. I have pounded that a bit too much, and I think it&#8217;s best for each one to find out for himself, like the poem says. I only talk general philosophy, for the sake for each person&#8217;s personal gains, SCN or not. I don&#8217;t want to antagonize anymore whether SCN is right or wrong. I might talk about TRs like I would talk about Tolle&#8217;s ideas.</p> <p>I am reluctant to defend Scientology, for the same reason I asked that rhetorical question about DM. For it doesn&#8217;t matter as much, in practice, what LRH intended, but it mostly matters what happens in the name of LRH. If I wanted to defend SCN, I would consider people that mess SCNists from inside, more harmful than people that antagonize SCN from the outside. It&#8217;s the same coin, but different sides. I try to go with the golden line.</p> <p>My stay in SCN was &#8217;98-&#8217;04, I think, and that was the duration of my doing TRs, as they were plenty.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment even depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330311"> 		<div id="comment-330311"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/350d54331c090bcdace0f231815a0dd3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">marildi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330311"> 				February 19, 2015 at 1:16 am</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>SP (I&#8217;ll just use your initials &#8211; joke! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-bigsmile' title=':D'>:D</span> ): &#8220;TRs are ‘too much body’, the way I see them. They are communication drills, not meditation.&#8221;</p> <p>That&#8217;s all they&#8217;re supposed to be &#8211; communication drills &#8211; their primary purpose. However, to me, OT-TR-0 and TR-0 are types of meditation (there are many types), not unlike what Eckhart Tolle describes.  </p> <p>&#8220;I don’t see how they relate to what I said about attempts to get me bullied.&#8221; </p> <p>TRs may not relate to every bully situation &#8211; depending on the bully. But I&#8217;m sure many people could attest to having handled some bully&#8217;s attitude simply by being there comfortably. Or maybe by giving him a really good ack, as another example.</p> <p>The interesting thing about TRs, and everything else in scientology, is that everyone can benefit at a level that suits wherever they happen to be as a being &#8211; if the tech is in, that is. What happened to you makes me wonder if the situation was similar to this quote from an early edition of NSOL, in an essay about Acceptance Level:</p> <p>&#8220;You can understand, too, some of you, why you were not acceptable in your own homes when you were young; you were too bright and too cheerful and this was too high above those around you.&#8221;</p> <p>You wrote: &#8220;I might talk about TRs like I would talk about Tolle’s ideas.&#8221;</p> <p>That&#8217;s really how I feel too (contrary to popular belief <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> ). But not everybody is willing to talk about some particular part of scientology in and of itself, separate from other parts. That&#8217;s one reason I like to talk to you, and a few others, because I know that you can have a straight comm cycle with me &#8211; and that you aren&#8217;t unwilling to say something good about scn. Or something bad, for that matter (with good TRs! <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-tongue' title=':P'>:P</span> ). You summed it up beautifully here:</p> <p>&#8220;For it doesn’t matter as much, in practice, what LRH intended, but it mostly matters what happens in the name of LRH.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;98-&#8217;04&#8243;? Well, no doubt there were &#8220;additives&#8221; on your course, especially since that was after GAT in &#8217;96.

Reading along, I started to wonder if Parmenides was your direct ancestor and that you inherited his DNA!</p> <p>As for what you said regarding &#8220;arguing about TRs, etc.&#8221;, what I think is that former scientologists seem to have a common bond &#8211; probably because most of us are seekers of truth.

Rich with love and compassion for his fellows.  You and I.  Driven to help man and mankind.  Obsessed to find the properties of life and living.  Plagued with demons and attackers, fanatically protecting his work.  Amazing powers of observation, insight, vision.  The ability to work, nonstop, for years if necessary to find the cause and solution for an outpoint.  He also had quite a talent for gathering and sifting through information, codifying it, and making it understandable and useable.</p> <p>That being said, he also had the ability to be harsh when he felt the purpose was valid.  He detested weakness and sloth to the point of being blind to the worth of individuals who may have temporarily displayed these qualities.  He demanded honesty and integrity, yet hid those lapses of his own, producing irreconcilable conflicts within himself.</p> <p>Traits which are not the least bit uncommon, but unforgivable in a leader of men.  He produced the most comprehensive system yet known for resolving an individual&#8217;s undesirable qualities, yet touted it as perfect and complete.  </p> <p>It is quite unfortunate that those who seized power over the group who was responsible for carrying on his work, are those whose main purpose were to seize power over others.  They will pass and times will change.  For the better, perhaps.  Maybe not.</p> <p>Hubbard had faults which he never overcame, and some which he did resolve.  The effects of those weaknesses that he clung to are affecting us all today.  But we are not beneath or inferior to him, nor weaker, nor blind.  We are not so superior that we can ignore his efforts.  We are bright enough to confront his perversions and embrace his discoveries.  But it is a tough road, a road which toughens.  The key is due diligence and joyful discipline.  That is where the fun begins.  And fun it can be.<br /> ARCL, Mark.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-christianscientology odd alt depth-8 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330137"> 		<div id="comment-330137"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/535874aa14b2cef0c4574543b07e8463?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">christianscientology</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330137"> 				February 14, 2015 at 4:38 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330137#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330137", "330137", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to christianscientology'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thanks for your post Mark.

I know I had eggs, ham and toast with apple butter this morning.  No opinion will change that.  Why my lady decided to make that particular breakfast is a little less sure.  Some believe that fact and opinion is a gradient or gray area, but there is a solid line that can be drawn between them.  The gradient comes after the line is crossed.  The ability to recognize the difference is a large portion of what we call judgement.  </p> <p>I sometimes write my experiences as fact for all, but that is because I write shortly after my observations while they are fresh and raw.  I like to leave some things open for your evaluation and opinion.  What is true for me is not necessarily true for you, and I like to gather others thoughts and ideas.

Perhaps it is when ‘opinion’ and ‘creative thought’ become certainty that creative becomes destructive.</p> <p>A past Archbishop of Canterbury here in England once said “fundamentalism whether it be Christian, Jewish or Islamic is the scourge of our time” (he could have added-in Scientology there as well).</p> <p>The certainty I was thinking of is where doctrine becomes dogma, when ‘my’ truth becomes THE TRUTH.</p> <p>My thinking was influenced by this video <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x20ohne_bbc-ascent-of-man-11-knowledge-or-certainty_tv" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x20ohne_bbc-ascent-of-man-11-knowledge-or-certainty_tv</a> which for me highlighted the difference between certainty and uncertainty, and how we used to believe that the physical universe was fixed by the laws discovered by people like Newton, and now as a result of Quantum Physics we have had to rethink things that we have taken as CERTAINTIES.  Thus making room for the idea ‘I’ might be mistaken, this is the missing factor in Scientology fundamentalism which pretty much agrees with the Christian fundamentalism.  “The Bible is the inspired word of God and is literally true” just change the word Bible for the word TECH and the word GOD for the word RON and you have a working definition of FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTOLOGY.</p> <p>Love<br /> Pip</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-8 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330140"> 		<div id="comment-330140"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/350d54331c090bcdace0f231815a0dd3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">marildi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330140"> 				February 14, 2015 at 5:47 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330140#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330140", "330140", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to marildi'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Wow, Mark.

I got invited (note that) to show them what I was into, and decided to show them a simple meditation technique that I knew.

The guy who didn&#8217;t try looked pissed for some reason, and talked to others (while they were doing it) and distracted them. Because of the resulting mess (including my protests about it) that meeting didn&#8217;t go well. </p> <p>After a few days I got invited to show it again, privately to that guy who didn&#8217;t do it, but created the mess. The message was that I was incapable (among other things, I dared to protest his attitude) to deliver it, but &#8216;others&#8217; could possibly do it, and &#8216;it seemed an interesting technique afterall&#8217;.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire even depth-6 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330053"> 		<div id="comment-330053"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330053"> 				February 12, 2015 at 7:23 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330053#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330053", "330053", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>My conclusion is that Hubbard tried to position Scientology using the popularity of Buddhism. He defined the goals of Scientology to be similar to the goals of Buddhism; and the state of Clear to be similar to the state of Bodhi. According to him, Scientology far surpassed the results of Buddhism.</p> <p>But the truth is that through the technique of mindfulness Buddha could see that the self was illusory, and he took steps to help others transcend that illusion. However, Hubbard and Scientology went in the opposite direction making the empowering of individuality to be its goal. These two goals are completely opposite of each other.

But the awareness of individuality is not something physical that can be pulled out of the body.</p> <p>The truth is that a person, whose attention is fixed on the body, and who has been operating as a body all his life, feels very liberated when that attention suddenly becomes unstuck. This comes to him as a big surprise. He literally feels being outside the body. He thinks that something very special has happened. He feels a deep “spiritual awakening,”</p> <p><strong>INTERIORIZATION is the condition of attention being too fixed on the body with the person unaware of it. When that attention suddenly becomes unstuck the person feels very liberated.</strong></p> <p>But the experience of being outside the body is just a feeling. The person does not know that he has been operating as a body all this time. The experience goes away just as suddenly as it had come because he does not have awareness of what really happened. But he remembers the brief experience and longs for it.</p> <p>Such “out-of-body” experiences are actually quite common, but they are random and uncontrolled. But after such experience the person&#8217;s attention may get fixed on getting exterior to the body.</p> <p><strong>When a person’s attention is too fixed on separating “self” from the body, then it is just another form of INTERIORIZATION.</strong></p> <p>Scientology convinces a person that he is basically an immortal “thetan” (self), that can operate exterior to the body naturally. The person is then offered expensive Scientology processing to attain the state of &#8220;operating thetan.&#8221; He is put on a long “bridge” that he must cross to achieve the goal of &#8220;operating thetan.&#8221;</p> <p>This may sound crazy. But a person, who already believes that there is a God who exists outside the universe, can easily be convinced to believe in a thetan that can exist outside the body.</p> <p>In truth, &#8220;self&#8221; is not something physical that can be separated from the body. What needs to be freed is the attention fixed on the body, which the person is not aware of.</p> <p>But Scientology directs the person toward the goal of &#8220;operating thetan,&#8221; and makes loads of money of him. The person ends up either hypnotized or feeling betrayed. No operating thetan has actually been observed throughout the existence of Scientology.</p> <p><strong>The simple truth lies in freeing the attention that is fixed on the body unbeknownst to the person.</strong></p> <p>But the attention can be fixed on the body, or on the liberation of self from the body, or on salvation, or on attaining nirvana. The actual problem is the state of the attention, which happens to be fixed.</p> <p>When the fixed attention actually becomes free, there is a feeling of liberation that continues to be there. With this, one attains the certainty that one is much more than some boxed in ideas and thinking patterns. This feeling is real and not the artificial feeling of an &#8220;operating thetan.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>When there is no fixed attention either on body or on self, one can then be as large as the reality one is witnessing at any time.</strong></p> <p>The simple method for freeing fixed attention is mindfulness. One can then view the whole universe for what it is.</p> <p>.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329772"> 		<div id="comment-329772"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b4e1c4cfb3baf5d0110c888632ec3b75?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Joe Pendleton</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329772"> 				February 7, 2015 at 7:50 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329772#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329772", "329772", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Joe Pendleton'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Vinaire, after very, very careful consideration of what you are saying here &#8230; I have concluded that &#8230; (drum roll please &#8230; tension mounts as the multitudes await my conclusion &#8230; ready?)   &#8230;.    the spirit can and does in fact obviously exist COMPLETELY separate from the body or any physical entity.

On the spectrum of physical inertia, frequency appears in the lower half, and mass appears on the upper half.</p> <p>Mental inertia is made up of the FIXEDNESS of attention, and the EGO of individuality. On the spectrum of mental inertia, fixedness appears in the lower half, and ego appears on the upper half.</p> <p>Based on the concept of inertia we may define SPACE and LOCATION as follows.</p> <p><b>PHYSICAL SPACE = A STATE DEVOID OF PHYSICAL INERTIA<br /> MENTAL SPACE = A STATE DEVOID OF MENTAL INERTIA</b></p> <p>Space may be defined as the lower end on the spectrum of inertia. Thus, physical space would be an electromagnetic wave of zero frequency and infinite wavelength.</p> <p>Mental space would be a state of attention that is totally free.</p> <p><b>PHYSICAL LOCATION = THE CENTER OF MASS<br /> MENTAL LOCATION = THE CENTER OF EGO</b></p> <p>A location may be defined as the upper end on the spectrum of inertia. Thus, physical location would be an infinite mass that is centered at a point. We visualize geometrical point to be dimensionless but discrete. On this concept of point we base the whole subject of geometry. But geometry is only as useful as it is consistent with physical observations.</p> <p>Mental location would be an immense ego that is centered at a “point”. The “point” is visualized as the spiritual “I”. On this concept of “I” we base the whole subject of spirituality, where God is the ultimate “I”. But spirituality is only as useful as it is consistent with what is experienced.</p> <p>The concept of SPIRIT is derived from the mental aspect of motion, just like the concept of MATTER is derived from the physical aspect of motion. Both spiritual and material aspects are present at every point on the spectrum of motion or inertia.</p> <p>When we talk about SPIRIT, we are talking about mental aspects and not the physical aspect. So, SPIRIT has to do with mental space and time, whereas, MATTER has to do with physical space and time. We cannot talk about SPIRIT in terms of physical space and time as it has been done in many religions.</p> <p>.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire odd alt depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329829"> 		<div id="comment-329829"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329829"> 				February 8, 2015 at 9:09 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329829#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329829", "329829", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Joe, you may not be aware of this, but you are just parroting Hubbard&#8217;s tripe.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-4 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329882"> 		<div id="comment-329882"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b4e1c4cfb3baf5d0110c888632ec3b75?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Joe Pendleton</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329882"> 				February 8, 2015 at 11:27 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329882#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329882", "329882", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Joe Pendleton'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Vinny &#8211;

advices of Hubbard&#8217;s, there&#8217;s the one &#8220;running program&#8221; advice that says that in ancient space civilization times that &#8220;OTs&#8221; (pure souls that didn&#8217;t have bodies but which existed and did duty on advanced ancient space civilization planets, think of superhero Caspar the Ghosts dutifully helping out on humanoid inhabited planets sort of like a Caspar the Ghost/Greek Gods force of &#8220;OTs&#8221;) when the &#8220;OTs&#8221; needed therapy, they&#8217;d go circle large expanses of outer space, as their therapy.  That&#8217;s in otherwords the &#8220;OT running program.&#8221;   It&#8217;s what the Scientology promo now calls the &#8220;Cause Resurgence Rundown&#8221;  or &#8220;OT objective.&#8221;   (Objective in Scientologese means &#8220;Objective Process&#8221;, like the &#8220;CCHs&#8221; or &#8220;Book and Bottle&#8221; are &#8220;Objective Processes&#8221;, and thus the OT running program is an &#8220;objective&#8221; process for disembodied soul astronauts.)</p> <p>Supposedly, then, how this all fits together, is that today, if you really believe in what all Hubbard wrote, and put this all together, it means that once you are &#8220;up to&#8221; this topnotch spiritual horsepower level, that Hubbard considers he himself had reached at his death, that when you then leave your body and &#8220;die&#8221; you can go off to a distant star, like Hubbard told Sarge Steven Pfauth as is told in &#8220;Going Clear..&#8221; and &#8220;Memoirs of a Scientology Warrier&#8221;, and supposedly today a Scientologist who is OT 8 or thereabouts could like dead Hubbard go do the OT running program yourself, as a rejuvenating OT horsepower amping up therapy on yourself.</p> <p>This is truly NOT to be taken seriously, but if one is a full blown brainwashed Scientologist who got themselves deep all the way in the Hubbard fantasy crank crackpot therapy then this is what this would mean.</p> <p>It&#8217;s more than irresponsible, it&#8217;s truly why Hubbard is a crank crackpot, and his &#8220;work&#8221; on this spiritual stuff is truly not to be taken seriously.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329817"> 		<div id="comment-329817"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6d9898a119241c960c0072f1e5f5c4d7?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Ftiend</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329817"> 				February 8, 2015 at 7:14 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329817#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329817", "329817", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Ftiend'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Running around a pole .. running around a star .. you can also run around your home if you want more power .. this run around something is good idea for one who is pretty well in disorder .. means you implant yourself a place for order .. and then create new order .. all athletic persons must then be in super power .. no, not really, because they do not handle disorder .. </p> <p>The LRH advice for running around something is the simpliest thing to do  for handle disorder .. best is to run run around a star.

I mean, with low power you would need about 900 billion years for one turn .. but at the end  you would have good havingness about .. but see, the galaxy is maybe at this time not longer there .. so it is maybe better to run around a sun .. or around a pole .. or around your home .. or around your desk .. </p> <p>Lets say it with my words, running around something ist only an order to yourself for having order. It is therapy, but nobody has ever need this as order from LRH .. if you are free, you can make every night a turn around the galaxy .. but only if you are not involved in disorder about it .. </p> <p>I have read once about blowing.

Many decades ago Woody Allen wrote an essay called &#8220;The Whore of Mensa&#8221; wherein a man could pay a woman to discuss very deep philosophical issues with him (Plato,  etc). Presumably one could pay someone to also engage in raising awareness about one&#8217;s spiritual nature. Oh wait &#8230; that&#8217;s been done. Anyway I will hapilly attempt to raise your awareness for free. Just your thanks and cogs are enough exchange for me.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329851"> 		<div id="comment-329851"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/49ed3747454eb55c10f4beccdb4fd4f6?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comments' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Conan</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329851"> 				February 8, 2015 at 2:20 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329851#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329851", "329851", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Conan'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Marty.

In this level of consciousness, sense data can be confirmed by an observer without necessarily implying understanding. More broadly, it is the state or quality of being aware of something. In biological psychology, awareness is defined as a human&#8217;s or an animal&#8217;s perception and cognitive reaction to a condition or event…</em></p> <p><em>“Awareness is a relative concept. An animal may be partially aware, may be subconsciously aware, or may be acutely unaware of an event. Awareness may be focused on an internal state, such as a visceral feeling, or on external events by way of sensory perception. Awareness provides the raw material from which animals develop qualia, or subjective ideas about their experience.”</em></p> <p>.</p> <p>Here awareness is being described in terms of human subjectivity. This subjectivity seems to be taken for granted as awareness. It is being used as a “standard” to measure the awareness of other animals, organisms and objects . An objective definition of awareness seems to be missing.</p> <p>In order to define awareness scientifically, let’s do the following thought experiment. Imagine being out there in the interstellar space, but with no stars or heavenly bodies around to provide any reference points. Pay attention to your motion. You will find that there is no awareness of motion even when you could be moving at the speed of light. Awareness arises only when there is motion relative to something else.</p> <p>Light that contributes to awareness seems to be made up of pure motion. Objects that contribute to awareness seem to be full of motion at molecular and atomic levels. Awareness of sensations, such as push and pull, seems to accompany changes in motion.</p> <p>Science talks about structure like visual cortex or other parts of the brain to explain awareness. But the brain too is made up of atoms and molecules, neurons and electrical impulses. All these things consist of motion. So there is motion outside the brain as well as inside the brain. Science is simply associating the motion inside the brain with awareness.</p> <p>It seems that awareness simply cannot be separated from motion. Any change that gives rise to awareness is fundamentally motion. Even the change in color amounts to the change in wavelength of light, and is thus a very fine motion.</p> <p>We are used to looking at awareness in human context only. Awareness appears to us as something very subjective and complex, but that may just be a human-centric perspective. It was the same human-centric perspective, which held that earth is at the center of the universe. If we look at awareness objectively, it is found to be intimately related to motion.</p> <p><strong> Motion and awareness seem to be aspects of each other.</strong></p> <p>Atoms consist of motion and an effect of that are the properties expressed in the periodic table. This motion in atoms is also atomic awareness. Simple motion associated with electromagnetic waves leads to simple properties. This represents simple awareness. Extremely complex motion associated with human configuration leads to complex properties. This represents complex awareness that we are intimately familiar with.</p> <p><strong>The properties of animated organisms and inanimate objects are an expression of the motion and awareness that they are composed of. </strong></p> <p>This is a very different take on awareness of which human awareness is a special case. If we move away from the narrow, human-centric view, we find that awareness is all around us.</p> <p><strong>The universe is imbued with motion, and thus, it is imbued with awareness.</strong></p> <p><a href="http://vinaire.me/2014/12/13/what-is-awareness-scientifically/" rel="nofollow"><b>What is Awareness, Scientifically?</b></a><br /> .</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment even depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-329986"> 		<div id="comment-329986"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/df446e55d540b29e3179a8b84bcee235?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Letting go</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-329986"> 				February 10, 2015 at 4:17 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=329986#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-329986", "329986", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Letting go'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>This would lead me to ask, is the planet or the ecosystem as a complex configuration on a much larger scale aware?

To me it doesn&#8217;t matter whether one has a list of sins that written down would fill a whole skyscraper, I don&#8217;t think it is my business to point them out &#8211;no matter who that person is, that is. And I practice more than forgiveness, usually. I practice &#8216;what happened yesterday shouldn&#8217;t matter today&#8217;.</p> <p>I also don&#8217;t wish to tell people what to think, so as to invalidate their view of things. I only want to address people that think maybe they don&#8217;t know everything about the talked-about subjects, and wish to read about my view. I do not claim to speak any universal truth, it&#8217;s just my view. And I do not wish to play any PR game for or against SCN. I am totally indifferent with what is going to happen, with that matter of PR. I don&#8217;t have any appetite to go against anybody&#8217;s firm belief that Hubbard was a master brainwasher, nor that people like me are the reason why SCN got messed up. I only address people that want to communicate. I&#8217;m not in the game of creating positive nor negative impressions against other impressions.</p> <p>I started to write online because somebody or some people taunted me, that I couldn&#8217;t communicate without their approval &#8211;and it was about something important. But since I have resolved the matter inside me, and I know I can communicate indeed, I have no reason why I should be engaged into that particular game. I would only be willing to communicate to like-minded people that take it easy, for I don&#8217;t feel like fighting.</p> <p>I think people -no matter what faction they might belong in- could take it a bit easy, because most of the things we talk about, don&#8217;t exist in present time. And for many, never have existed, ever. This should go to all directions, as a light hearted advice, and not as an effort to stop things forcefully. I think a desire for revenge corrodes from inside, no matter the fair causes that might back that up &#8211;and of course, I&#8217;m talking generally, and not just about Scientology. If I wanted to be free from something, I would practice &#8216;F*ck it&#8217; or &#8216;let go&#8217;.</p> <p>So as not to talk about things totally irrelevant to the topic, I don&#8217;t feel any enforcement to study nor practice Scientology, and I haven&#8217;t done either in a long time. Still I think -if taken lightly, and if done willingly- it could be an interesting subject to get into. For me, it has much to do with personal interpretations and then personal application. Not few people have interpreted love and freedom as hate and war. And fortunately we are now -politically- at a point where we can make our choices for ourselves &#8211;unless &#8216;we&#8217; live in Iran or other countries with enforced and hardcore ideologies. I think there is room for even more freedom, like education could be more individual-based than society-based, &#8211;an individual should decide what to learn.</p> <p>I have also &#8216;moved on&#8217; to other stuff that are to a degree alligned with Scientology, but are other stuff, and they are noname. They are my stuff <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-tongue' title=':P'>:P</span> Still, I don&#8217;t have any sentiments about possibly negative or extremely negative past experiences in Scientology, as I don&#8217;t have any past hidden anywhere waiting to jump up and eat me. I could of course think of some past and make some sentiments, but what for? I preffer computer games. I had a purpose in the past to &#8216;awaken&#8217; others form what I considered negative in Scientology, but I only have one now to only share with those willing to share. I&#8217;m not going to pound anything to anybody. And by &#8216;share&#8217; I mean share how to be better, not what is wrong.</p> <p>Sorry for the long text.

I did not know what they meant but they did seem familiar.  After Googling the expression I came across this book “Suing for Peach: a Guide for Resolving Life’s Conflicts”.  Having read the preview I ordered it from Amazon.</p> <p>Basically what it is saying is when we perceive that someone has taken our happiness away we react by taking away their happiness in the mistaken belief that in so doing we will regain our happiness.  However the other person now deeming his happiness has been taken away reacts by attempting to take away the other’s happiness.  This belief that another can take away our happiness seems to be what lies behind the overt-motivator sequence.</p> <p>I can only speak for myself but when I got involved in Scientology it was the happiest time of my life, so when I was expelled it was the most unhappy time of my life.  I could have easily become bitter and retaliated to what I perceived as unfair treatment, but instead I resolved to continue to investigate why I had been expelled.</p> <p>I can say now with comparative certainty that the main problem in the CofS is its inability to think outside the parameters of the technology of Scientology which produces an inability to see other viewpoints that apparently conflict with the Scientology paradigm. </p> <p>Over the years I have met enough fundamentalists to know one challenges their stable datum at one’s peril, for it is their stable datum from which they derive their happiness, and as the book I am recommending points out when our happiness is threatened our reaction is to attempt to restore it by taking away the other person’s happiness.  I don’t believe any sane person wants to see “Scientology at War” and I am confident by applying the principles in this book forgiveness can be achieved on both sides in any conflict.  Do look at the website <a href="http://www.jameskimmeljr.com/literary/suing-for-peace/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jameskimmeljr.com/literary/suing-for-peace/</a> </p> <p>Love with Understanding<br /> Pip</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-spyrosillusionist even depth-3 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330083"> 		<div id="comment-330083"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1e3a3898eb06ac9bec55d9581e9d1dd4?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://spyrosillusionist.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Spyros</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330083"> 				February 13, 2015 at 9:38 am</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330083#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330083", "330083", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to Spyros'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thank you.</p> <p>I agree, it can become a vicious circle to seek revenge &#8211;specially from people that have nothing to do with the matter.</p> <p>I think if somebody tried to really harm me or something I care for, I would defend. But from then on to search for the person to take revenge doesn&#8217;t feel good to me. I think I would have to boil in my juice, from then on, to have a reason to take that revenge. In a way, I would attack myself.</p> <p>And beyond that I think that ethics and justice exist. And one who would harm continuously wouldn&#8217;t have a good time with it. Sometimes, some people&#8217;s &#8216;success&#8217; is only an image they project. </p> <p>Others might look upon such people for their being &#8216;successful&#8217; or &#8216;powerful&#8217;.

And when it comes to the subject o spirit or God, it&#8217;s the same. I don&#8217;t really agree with Christ nor Mohamed. I once opened a quoran that somebody had left at some book exchange, in some random page explaining how to punish your wife right, and it really wasn&#8217;t my thing. Those punishments and sufferings are not my idea of spirituality. Nor is it to feel serene about anything you do. I think feelings could work as compass. And feeling like #$%$%$ could indicate something is not OK. </p> <p>My &#8216;basic&#8217; agreements with religions are agreements they themselves have with philosophies too.</p> <p>Most often I find movements talking about something I agree with, then adding stuff I really disagree with. So, I try to have things my own way, whether I partially agree with groups or not. I think, in spirituality, the core of what one looks for is inside.</p> <p>I understand atheists arguments too and most often I agree. </p> <p>I don&#8217;t think that if religions get wiped out, the world will be free -particularly brainwash-free- either. Proof is some past atheist countries. Brainwashing can come in many flavors, so long as there are people to sell and buy it.</p> <p>In any case, since there are also many beliefs and brainwashes of many flavors, I think we must -at least- respect each other&#8217;s views &#8211;without that meaning to agree with them. And respect those who respect. I would personally not respect one who would want to impose his views on me or a friend. But also I think it is a waste of time, for myself, to fight those who don&#8217;t intend to respect. </p> <p>Anarchists have the motto &#8216;No gods no masters&#8217;. I&#8217;m close, as I don&#8217;t want bosses above my head, but I keep my (own) spiritual stuff, and try to avoid unnecessary collisions. For anyway, fighting is a way to impose something, even if it is a fight-back, no?</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire odd alt depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330663"> 		<div id="comment-330663"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330663"> 				February 24, 2015 at 9:46 pm</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p><i>Spyros: &#8220;Generally speaking, I think the less vias, the better.

Some big disagreements that I have with Christianity are that we must suffer on Earth to be rewarded in Heaven, that God is a judge, and a couple of passages I read that say that JC coaxed people to be respectful to their Earthly masters, like they would be towards God. Of course, it could be that JC never said such things. And that is very important, Like I think about some cases that LRH didn&#8217;t mean for SCN to be how it is, and that fanatic LRHers are as SCNists as fanatic crusaders were Christians. </p> <p>I have thought all that you wrote above too.

Just to point out differences between my experiences and my studies. </p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire even depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330768"> 		<div id="comment-330768"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330768"> 				February 27, 2015 at 9:37 pm</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>All monotheisistic religions make the same error.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-christianscientology odd alt depth-10 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330877"> 		<div id="comment-330877"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/535874aa14b2cef0c4574543b07e8463?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">christianscientology</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330877"> 				March 3, 2015 at 11:43 am</a> 					| 													</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hi Spyros</p> <p>Being a ChristianScientologist is not an easy road to walk but is very exciting.

I do other things in my life. I fancy to talk philosophy, or else I have no business here. And that&#8217;s what I think I (could) have in common with (some) Scientologists in here, as well as some others. You want to hold a court against LRH and SCN and religionists. Not my business. And what I said the other days about harsh criticism wasn&#8217;t to make you guilty, but to have a civilized discussion, altogether, with SCN people too, and I would tell them the same too, if they were all accusations and stuff (I have). If it doesn&#8217;t happen, not much will change for me. I hope you can grasp a thing or two of what I wrote now.

Actually, you didn&#8217;t either. </p> <p>Spyros:&#8221;Yet, look how some create hate between those two. It’s the humans that do it&#8221; </p> <p>By those &#8216;some&#8217; I meant their spiritual leaders as well, of course. Those who want to kill all Christians or all Muslims. And those who speak about &#8216;love&#8217; but with some exceptions (like when the works of Satan are involved, that we shouldn&#8217;t love) &#8230;where the exceptions might as well be 99% of the cases. So, Conan, we don&#8217;t disagree about that. And actually I also spoke of the basics, that meant actually, love and such stuff &#8211;without the &#8216;exceptions&#8217;.</p> <p>Other than that Conan, to condemn anything spiritual as insane, is not religious alright, but is of similar nature as to codemn anything non religious as a sin, Satan&#8217;s work, SP and so on. </p> <p>Regardless of how you think things are, maybe you could let other people to think their own stuff too, if they don&#8217;t shove that stuff down other people&#8217;s throats, that is. Do you think only a Scientologist would have such ideas? Do you think it&#8217;s either &#8216;I love it all&#8217; or &#8216;I hate it all?&#8221;. My own purpose Conan is not to PR pro- nor anti- any group. I have my own purposes for myself, and I use those ideas that serve me, for as long as they do. Thus I can also change them. My income is not dependent upon them, nor do I report to anybody.</p> <p>If such ideas don&#8217;t serve you, dump them and piss on them too, if you will. But I think to go around calling all those people, including myself crazy etc is a bit on the manipulative side. Quite ironic if you say you stand against Scientology&#8217;s manipulation. </p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-8 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330426"> 		<div id="comment-330426"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/350d54331c090bcdace0f231815a0dd3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">marildi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330426"> 				February 20, 2015 at 8:22 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330426#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330426", "330426", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to marildi'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Damn, Spyros.

Same thing can be said about Scientology, though there is precious little that is new and really useful in Scientology.</p> <p>If Scientology has its Xenu, then Christianity has its God as &#8220;creator.&#8221; The idea of &#8220;God as creator of the universe&#8221; is no less inconsistent than the idea of Xenu.

Navigation through the only hole in the wall consists of closely emulating Hubbard and behaving as he did when he lived.</p> <p>  When the animals decided to establish schools they selected a school board consisting of Mr. Elephant, Mr. Kangaroo and Mr. Monkey, and these fellows held a meeting to agree upon their plans.<br />     “What shall the animals’ children be taught in the animal school? That is the question,” declared Mr. Monkey.<br />     “Yes, that is the question,” exclaimed Mr. Kangaroo and Mr. Elephant together.</p> <p>    “They should be taught to climb trees,” said the monkey, positively. “All my relatives will serve as teachers.”<br />     “No, indeed!” shouted the other two, in chorus. “That would never do.”<br />     “They should he taught to jump,” cried the kangaroo, with emphasis. “All of my relatives will be glad to teach them.”<br />     “No, indeed!” yelled the other two, in unison. “That would never do.”<br />     “They should be taught to look wise,” said the elephant. “And all of my relatives will act as teachers.”<br />     “No, indeed!” howled the other two together. “That will never do.”</p> <p>    “Well, what will do?” they asked, as they looked at each other in perplexity.<br />     “Teach them to climb,” said Mr. Monkey.<br />     “Teach them to jump,” said Mr. Kangaroo.<br />     “Teach them to look wise,” said Mr. Elephant.<br />     And so it was that none of them would yield, and when they saw there was no chance to agree, they all became angry and decided not to have any animal schools at all.</p> <p><a

Once you know Hubbard’s sources, including his undisclosed intentions, the entire house of cards crumbles.<br /> A sleight of hand from a master hypnotist, as it creates a difference of potential between the Operator and its subjects, from whom commands can flow down and stick as memes.</p> <p>I and others have noted many times before that knowledge about the mind, its processes and phenomena has been extensively studied and recorded in the East for thousands of years.<br /> Particularly that Buddhism is the largest reservoir of knowledge on the subject.</p> <p>In the late 1800’s two major events occurred that advanced human thought in the West:</p> <p>One was the publishing of The Egyptian Book of the Dead and The Pyramid Texts which essentially revealed the source and history of Religion and Magic in the West and showed the three main monotheistic cults as emperors with no clothes.</p> <p>The other was the publishing of Buddhist and Vedic sacred texts, along with disseminating Yoga and meditation practices.</p> <p>The Theosophical Society had a big hand in syncretizing and popularizing both aspects of this ancient spiritual knowledge. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophical_Society" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophical_Society</a></p> <p>Hubbard’s main source, Aleister Crowley was at the forefront of this movement and incorporated all of  this esoterica into his Thelema system. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4</a></p> <p>I think a must read for recovering Scientologists and others is Crowley’s Essay on Yoga, brilliantly written, you will see Hubbard’s “unique” insights into the mind plagiarized from Yoga, via Crowley.<br /> See <a href="http://hermetic.com/crowley/eight-lectures-on-yoga/" rel="nofollow">http://hermetic.com/crowley/eight-lectures-on-yoga/</a></p> <p>It is obvious to me that Scientologists lack the most basic common sense to be able to understand the processes involved in auditing, the similarities and differences between the various states induced by focusing attention on mental  objects, as done under Reverie, Meditative Absorption or under<br /> Hypnosis.</p> <p>Well, just remedy that ignorance and lift yourself up to be at par with Hubbard&#8217;s knowledge and hopefully exceed it.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-martyrathbun09 comment-author-is-site-member bypostauthor odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330219"> 		<div id="comment-330219"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c2d94d163a566268e73c8b0195b6c03a?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">Mark C.

I was trying to say<br /> that, in Original Buddhism, it does not matter if the being is<br /> in or out of time.  As I said before, this does not prove the definition<br /> of the &#8220;I&#8221; or the spirit.  It only means that it is not important in the<br /> overall picture.  It is the elimination of the Karma that causes<br /> these states which is important.<br />      I read Tom Campbell and your analysis of exteriorization.<br /> If you go back 2,600 years, there are numerous stories of<br /> astral bodies, duplicate bodies,  and exteriorization.

With scientific protocol, he proved that a being &#8211; the “I” or spirit &#8211; does exist and that it is separate and distinct from the body. Nevertheless, I do get what you’re saying as regards the Buddhist view that “I” is impermanent and is not important in the overall picture.</p> <p>With respect to the word “impermanent”, the main point in my previous post had to do with Hubbard’s statement that above the tone scale “beingness CAN exist without any energy or matter, which is to say, without time” in relation to your statement that “it is NOT NECESSARY to return” (my caps throughout).</p> <p>In other words, you used the words “not necessary” – which could mean that one CAN return, although it is “not necessary”. Does that idea about nibbana/nirvana exist, i.e. that one could choose to return? </p> <p>If so, then it still seems to me that the views to do with &#8220;I&#8221; are expressed differently from Buddhist views, but that the basic ideas might amount to the same thing.

Hubbard described himself as on a mission in the role of Lucifer.  I had to write the book in order to give public testimony.  At sixty-nine years of age, I wanted to get the data on blogs, into the hands of former members, and into libraries.  I met Miscavige on the Freewinds in 1988 when he was in the process of killing it.<br /> Since I was trained in the Bible by Jesuits at Holy Cross College, I instantly duplicated where Hubbard was coming from and where he was going.  In college, we spent time with the greatest scholars in the world on issues such as the  anti-Christ and other &#8220;miracles&#8221;. Thus I left Scientology but not before a few tense moments.  Hubbard&#8217;s comments on Buddhism alerted me to his flaws.  Oddly enough, we were drilled on Buddhism at Holy Cross in 1964 by very fine scholars.  Thus I knew both ends that Hubbard failed to resolve.<br />     In no way do I claim to be an expert in Scientology.  In fact, I have carefully steered away from the 1989-2015 time period.  All I have ever said is that I survived that day in 1989 and I am alive to tell about it.  Many of my  friends have passed.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment odd alt depth-5 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330278"> 		<div id="comment-330278"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/350d54331c090bcdace0f231815a0dd3?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn">marildi</cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330278"> 				February 17, 2015 at 10:48 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330278#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330278", "330278", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to marildi'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hi G,<br /> Thanks very much.

Just saw the trailers for the documentary.  Did you see them yet Dave?  I am actually getting sweamish.  It&#8217;s getting hard to watch your justice cycles. Seriously.</p> <p>Well, every dog has their day. I was kind of hoping you would just go away. Didn&#8217;t expect to see this blood bath. I mean, everyone is going to know you are on a motivator flow. You know, the public. Some of them are going to feel ashamed for remaining so oblivious. I did. It is a much bigger flap than the G.O. bust with Mary Sue. You know that by now don&#8217;t you? You really out created everyone with the &#8220;bad boy&#8221; routine!   </p> <p>Then there are all of these law suits you are fighting, fraud, domestic terrorism.  Your underlings doing your bidding and having it all backfire. Like everyone in the legal community isn&#8217;t going to be watching this documentary right?  The president of the United States is probably going to see it.</p> <p>Well, every dog has their day. I mean, you are SOOOOOOOOOOO busted.  It is brutal. It was hard for me to watch the trailer.  My in box is full already from friends and family and they are like, &#8220;Hey, are you still mixed up in that?&#8221; One friend emailed me  from Israel!  They are seeing this trailer in Israel!!  Jeeeeze! </p> <p>Kind of strange your justice cycles all over the news and television. I have no idea how you can get on stage again after this and do your periodic &#8220;applaud for me&#8221; routines.</p> <p>Well, every dog has their day. Not sure I can watch anymore. It&#8217;s not easy anymore. Not curious like I used to be.

(I leave this message here because I know you read Marty&#8217;s blog) . I just have to say, I am really disappointed with your inability to think with conditions. It&#8217;s only at &#8220;clear&#8221; on the awareness characteristics. Aren&#8217;t you even a clear? Duh!!! The guy running the Church isn&#8217;t even a clear!!  Well, by now that is rather obvious. I mean, you seem to be at &#8220;oblivious&#8221;  on the awareness characteristics.</p> <p>Has there NEVER been a staff qual officer at the Int base who had the courage to point out to you that you are oblivious???  </p> <p>Having Louis read his success story about justice only being possible in the Church, in a courtroom in Florida????????????????  DUH!!!!  How ignorant and dense!!!</p> <p>Do you honestly think the judge is going to make someone &#8221; right &#8221; for a statement like that, and permit injustice now?  Or lack of justice?</p> <p>It pains me to watch you orchestrate your own legal cycles!!!!!</p> <p>And to think you could have just cut a check and admitted some out exchange!!!!  But NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO you had to spend another few million to act an idiot in a Florida courtroom and open Scientologists everywhere up to new harassment, out P.R., and Lord knows, more heat from their associates for even mingling over at their local CofS!</p> <p>How do you snatch 250K from someone, then, when they are not happy because of the fraud and no exchange, tell them to F*%K OFF, spend twice that much to avoid putting them back at peace?  Are these optimum solutions? Isn&#8217;t this out ethics even by your own standards?</p> <p>You have become ethics bait, in the world at large.</p> <p>Are you even aware of your own condition now?</p> <p>It looks like this:</p> <p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='500' height='312' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4DDLyNS9rxw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	<ul class="children"> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-oraclemysticism odd alt depth-2 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330420"> 		<div id="comment-330420"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/62094ea8485520b990be9f9d0dd38dd2?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://gravatar.com/oraclemysticism' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>The Oracle</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330420"> 				February 20, 2015 at 5:39 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330420#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330420", "330420", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to The Oracle'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Here is David Miscavige, has his attorney in a Florida Courtroom, waving around a memo labeled &#8220;SUCCESS STORY&#8221; , wherein a member of the Church is writing that the justice system outside of the Church is useless.

I redacted it from my post on Mike&#8217;s blog yesterday.</p> <p>Mike, you made a discriminating assessment between what constitutes a Religion and what are the public perceptions and legal expectations of what a religion should be. Two very different things.</p> <p>No government in the West is ever going to deny Scientologists the right to practice their faith, whether dependent or independent of the Church. What will eventually happen, is the Justice System will catch up with Scientology’s fraud and abuse and force the Church to conform to the laws of civil society, and make them stop their wholesale violations of people’s civil the rights.</p> <p>In third world countries where Catholicism prevails, you can see the craziest syntheses of native shamanism, witchcraft, black and white magic all mixed up with the Christian faith, etc.</p> <p>NOBODY CARES. NOBODY INTERFERS with anyone’s practice of their religion.</p> <p>Scientologists will have their faith, they just need to get used to behaving like any other religion, be upfront and honest about what they believe and what they do. And part of that is getting used to having their Theology openly discussed like everybody else in the West.</p> <p>Peace and Enlightment.</p> </div>  	</div><!-- #comment-##  -->  	</li><!-- #comment-## --> 	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-vinaire odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 highlander-comment" id="li-comment-330662"> 		<div id="comment-330662"> 		<div class="comment-author vcard"> 			<img alt='' src='https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c743e7f3c77f15d38d8298be31d9780?s=48&#038;d=identicon&#038;r=G' class='avatar avatar-48' height='48' width='48' /> 			<cite class="fn"><a href='http://vinaire.wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>vinaire</a></cite>  			<span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> 				| 				<a href="https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/#comment-330662"> 				February 24, 2015 at 9:42 pm</a> 					| 					<a class='comment-reply-link' href='/2015/02/03/scientology-beliefs/?replytocom=330662#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-330662", "330662", "respond", "11823" )' aria-label='Reply to vinaire'>Reply</a>								</span><!-- .comment-meta .commentmetadata --> 		</div><!-- .comment-author .vcard --> 		 		<div class="comment-body"><p>Het Brian, you haven&#8217;t answered my question yet.
