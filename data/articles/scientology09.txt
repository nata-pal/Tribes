Samuelsson quit the cult&#8217;s Sea Borg where he had worked like a slave.  His long hours at an absurdly low rate of pay; Scientology has no shame when it comes to money; they sent him a bill for the courses he took.  He found a good way to pay them back.</p> <p>My name is Per-Olof Samuelsson<strong><em>, but if I have met any of you, you might remember me as Sam Samuelsson, because everybody used to call me that in my youth.</em></strong></p> <p>I was involved with Scientology for about a decade, from 1967 to 1977, the last five years as a Sea Org member. I worked as a Swedish translator at Pubs DK in Copenhagen. I left the SO and the CofS in October 1977 with the firm intention never to return. I have since been living a fairly happy and productive wog life.</p> <p>In the early 80s I received demands from the CofS that I repay my &#8220;free-loader debt&#8221;. I figured out that, since this is a debt that is accumulated over a period of one billion years, it can also be paid back over a period of one billion years, so I agreed to pay it in installments of 0.05 Swiss Francs every one thousandth year. The CofS wasn&#8217;t exactly happy with this solution, but I also wrote an article about it which I managed to get published in a Swedish magazine. Since then, the CofS has left me virtually alone. (There were a couple of feeble attempts to make me accept &#8220;amnesties&#8221;, but this was also in the 80s.) I haven&#8217;t even had to think about Scientology since then (frankly, I have lost all interest in the subject).</p> <p>However, quite recently, the CofS seems to have decided that I have no more urgent wish in life than to rejoin and &#8220;come back on lines&#8221;. A few months ago, I began getting phone calls from somebody in Copenhagen. I told him I am not interested (I even asked him to look up the word &#8220;not&#8221; in a good dictionary and then use it in a few sentences, until he understood the word &#8211; to no avail, of course). Finally, I got so fed up with this that I disconnected my phone (I was going to change to using a mobile anyway, but this hastened my decision to do so).</p> <p>As if this were not enough, in the beginning of June I received a letter from the Director of Income at AOSH Europe together with a statement of my &#8220;free-loader bill&#8221;. The accompanying letter told me &#8220;one very good data from LRH is that communication can solve any problem&#8221; and that &#8220;I will try to help you as much as I can and I think you also can help me&#8221;. Obviously the girl thinks that making financial demands that would ruin me for life, if I took them seriously, is &#8220;helping&#8221; me.</p> <p>I have reported both those matters to the police in Copenhagen, but I have not received an answer yet.</p> <p>So what I wonder is if anybody on this forum has some advice as how I should go about getting those people off my back.</p> <p>This was posted on the Ex-Scientologist Member Board.  To read it and the follow-up statements go here.  <a href="http://www.forum.exscn.net/showthread.php?12694-Introducing-myself/page2&amp;highlight=samuelsson">http://www.forum.exscn.net/showthread.php?12694-Introducing-myself/page2&amp;highlight=samuelsson</a></p> </div> <div class="meta"> 			Published in: <ul class="post-categories"> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/ex-scientology/" rel="category tag">ex-Scientology</a></li> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/sea-org-or-staff-members/" rel="category tag">Sea Org or Staff Members</a></li></ul>	 	 on August 11, 2011 at 9:45 pm 	&nbsp;<a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/11/ex-scientologist-story-264-how-to-repay-the-freeloaders-debt/#respond">Leave a Comment</a>	&nbsp;	<br /> 	</div> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/pub/quentin/images/printer.gif" width="102" height="27" class="pmark" alt=" " />  </div>    <div class="post-2091 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-danger-scientology-at-work"> <h2 class="storytitle" id="post-2091"><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/the-childrens-rpf-more-shame-for-scientology/" rel="bookmark">The Childrens RPF, More shame for&nbsp;Scientology.</a></h2>   <div class="storycontent"> <p><a href="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/hitleryouth-s1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2094" title="Hitler&amp;Youth-s" src="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/hitleryouth-s1.jpg?w=470" alt=""   /></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The control Scientology holds on their members is savage and fanatical.  Turning kids into Ron Bots will help fill the Sea Org coffers more than boys and girls who indeed, &#8220;think for themselves.&#8221;  It is a crime that things like this take place in a country founded on the rights of individuals.   This is something that should have died with the Third Reich.</p> <span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='470' height='295' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/kW8ZqGSkXjI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span> </div> <div class="meta"> 			Published in: <ul class="post-categories"> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/danger-scientology-at-work/" rel="category tag">Danger: Scientology at Work.</a></li></ul>	 	 on August 10, 2011 at 8:28 pm 	&nbsp;<a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/the-childrens-rpf-more-shame-for-scientology/#respond">Leave a Comment</a>	&nbsp;	<br /> 	</div> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/pub/quentin/images/printer.gif" width="102" height="27" class="pmark" alt=" " />  </div>    <div class="post-2082 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-ex-scientology category-sea-org-or-staff-members"> <h2 class="storytitle" id="post-2082"><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/ex-scientologist-story-263-kevin-g-brady-another-family-hurt-by-the-cult/" rel="bookmark">Ex-Scientologist story #263, Kevin G.

It took me three years to get them out after I myself left &#8211; three years of fear and threats and lies. I&#8217;m only sorry I didn&#8217;t succeed when I originally left. I could have stopped the cadet org abuse from ever occurring. I found out after my children had grown how they were beaten and sexually abused while in the Cadet org. I wish I had known. For everything that happened to them &#8211; at the beach when they were forcefully taken from me &#8211; to their stint in the Cadet org in PAC I am so truly sorry. They won&#8217;t talk about that time in their lives. I don&#8217;t blame them. I won&#8217;t go into details &#8211; many things happened and many are bad. They are free and they are living their lives happily now. For that I thank God!&#8221; Ozzie</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>&#8220;My Son, I am sorry for the neglect I subjected you to while I was on staff. You deserved my love and care, instead you received ethics handlings and fear. Please forgive me.&#8221;</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>&#8220;I was going through a very serious crisis, and concerned that I might be dangerous to myself and others, and the Church fed this idea by declaring me a &#8220;Suppressive Person&#8221;. I was compliant with this, and decided it would be best for you if I left, and if I didn&#8217;t insinuate myself into your lives. I thought it would be best for you if I cut the cord&#8230; Nitza, I recently watched the movie &#8220;Hard Problems&#8221;, and it was wonderful to see you again, even if through a movie camera. Zeb, I&#8217;m very proud of you for your success, and glad to see that you have remained the person I remember so well from your early years, although you&#8217;ve obviously grown a lot and deepened into the man you&#8217;re becoming. Gabby, what can I say. A daughter is famously the apple of a father&#8217;s eye, and you are no exception, for me. I am very sorry for my poor judgment being involved with that Church, and words cannot express how sorry I am that you paid the price for my ignorance and poor judgment when I was a teen parent.&#8221; Kevin G.

You can look far and wide yet you will not see any of the paraphernalia such as facines and sap rollers inching their way forward to the next parallel.  Armchair generals will look in vain for howitzers and mortars used to blast the counterscarp and covered ways into smithereens.  </span></div> <div></div> <div><span style="font-size:small;"><a href="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/the-alamo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2078" title="the-alamo" src="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/the-alamo.jpg?w=300&#038;h=217" alt="" width="300" height="217" /></a>      </span></div> <div></div> <div><span style="font-size:small;">Since the Mexican Army has been ruled out your next guess would be terrorists and extremists running amok with AK-47&#8217;s and screaming for Allah.  The mental image of these turbaned fighters landing on the beach like we did at Iwo Jima presents a stirring mental image but no, no such invasion has transpired.  </span></div> <div></div> <div><span style="font-size:small;">The invasion that I have alluded to thus far does indeed have something to do with extremists but not of the Islamic variety.  Nope, these folk are Scientologists; it is not for </span><span style="font-size:small;">Allah these wild-eyed fanatics cry for, it is for David Miscavige.   </span></div> <div></div> <div><span style="font-size:small;">The hell you say.  David who?  What?  The admiral of the Scientologists in Texas??  </span></div> <div></div> <div><span style="font-size:small;">Well, not in person, he is known as taking a dim view of exposing his own carcase to any physical danger.  He has sent flunkies, private investigators and deranged people who think they are &#8220;Operating Thetans,&#8221; or simply &#8220;OTs.&#8221;  These people believe they have special powers.  The truth is that they are deluded and lack even ordinary &#8220;powers.&#8221;</span></div> <div></div> <div><span style="font-size:small;">So what is this all about?  Well, it is a fairly simple story.  A couple of former stooges of David Miscavige, Mike Rinder and Marty Rathbun, got disgusted with the way he was running things and decided to quit and go out on their own.  They did not give up on the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard, only the way the organization was being run by Miscavige.  Since leaving a few years ago they have banded together with other like minded people to practice Scientology the way they say it was intended to be practiced.  These people, who are termed &#8220;independent Scientologists,&#8221;

he tells how to get a refund from the Melbourne Org.  After reading this you understand why it is so hard on the local Scientology orgs to refund money.  They have already sent money uplines, which will never come back, and they have spent the rest of it on the usual expenses.  So in order to pay the money back they must first take it in.  If everyone who had money on account in Melbourne wanted the money back that was still unused for services, hell, it would bankrupt them!!</p> <p><a href="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/topbdayplayer1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2040" title="TopBDayplayer" src="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/topbdayplayer1.jpg?w=470" alt=""   /></a></p> <p><strong>AN OPEN LETTER TO MELBOURNE PUBLIC</strong></p> <p>In the interests of disclosing that which the church wont disclose, and helping those the church wont help (its own public) I want to explain to you some points on the church&#8217;s public accounts system. That is the money that you, the paying public (and paying staff members) have put onto their own accounts at the Church of Scientology. Generally, this advice is applicable to all orgs, but as I was on staff in the Treasury Division at the Melbourne org I can talk specifically about Melbourne.</p> <p>Some back ground data on me. My name is Scott Bradley. I was, until earlier this year, the Director of Income at the Melbourne Day org. If you are still onlines there then you may have heard some black PR regarding the reasons for me no longer being there. The church can say what it likes. I will present you some facts about me just so you may put any black PR you have encountered into contact with some truth, and decide for yourself what sort of person I am.</p> <p><strong>THE CURRENT SCENE</strong></p> <p>The current scene at Melbourne Day is that they have $1 million approximately in undelivered services. This means that over the decades they have been in operation they have collected this money but never delivered the services being paid for. This also means that the money still, legally, belongs to the public who put that money onto their account. It does not belong to the church. These are referred to as advanced payments. I am not talking about money already spent by having received services or materials.</p> <p>In the first few months of this year, whilst I was still on staff, the Melbourne Day org refunded approximately $40,000 of advanced payments. It took several months each time, as the Org has to obtain that money anew before they can refund it. When the org originally receives it, they allocate it per LRH policy at the weekly FP meeting. Percentages go to Int Management via Flag. Promotion is funded. Bills are paid. And if it is a reasonably good week then staff are paid. Money is also put aside into a reserve account, and into a CVB account. CVB stands for Claims Verification Board. It is from this account that refunds are paid. However, as mentioned above Melbourne has $1,000,000 liability, but they most certainly do not have $1,000,000 in their CVB account (closer to $5,000 or $10,000). They have spent that $1,000,000 in operational costs. In other words, the public who have yet to recieve most of their services have been funding the operation and survival of the Melbourne org. I would think that it is the case in most orgs around the world.</p> <p>So, in my experience, the org does refund. Especially if it gets onto the DSA&#8217;s lines. It just doesn&#8217;t do it immediately, as it doesn&#8217;t have the funds available.</p> <p>Now, what if a significant percentage of these monies paid for services as yet undelivered were requested refunded by the public? It would have a serious negative impact on the Melbourne org. And remember, it isn&#8217;t their money in the first place. Not until they have delivered the services.</p> <p>So if you are, or have ever been a public at the Melbourne org, you may actually have funds sitting on account doing nothing. It is still yours.</p> <p><strong>HOW TO FIND OUT IF YOU HAVE FUNDS ON ACCOUNT AT THE MELBOURNE ORG</strong></p> <p>First thing you want to do is request an &#8220;Account Statement&#8221; from the Treasury Secretary &#8211; Greg Peart. An Account Statement lists out money on account. You may also want to request an &#8220;Account History&#8221;, and list the time period you want this for. This lists out all the individual transactions related to your account &#8211; &#8220;Credits&#8221; = money paid onto account, &#8220;Debits&#8221; &#8211; money used from account, to pay for services or materials. The computer system has been operational since 1996. All account details from before this period is in the hard copy files. The data still exists and is available.</p> <p>When you confirm if you have money on account with Melbourne Day (or Foundation &#8211; two seperate orgs), next step is to write a letter requesting this money to be refunded as you no longer wish to recieve Scientology services. Write to the Treasury Secretary (Greg Peart), and CC (carbon copy) to DSA (Mary Anderson). Make sure to CC to the DSA. The Treasury Secretary will be concerned only about the financial impact that your refund request has on the Org, but the DSA will be primarily concerned about the negative PR, and legal, affect your request will have. The DSA will want you handled and sent on your way asap. Use these two opposite dynamics to your advantage.</p> <p>Give it at most about two weeks to hear back from the Treasury Secretary about what his plans are for refunding you your money. Remember at all times &#8211; it is YOUR money. Expect it to take a month or more, depending on how much you are requesting. If you have $20,000 or more then you should allow a few months realistically. But keep in communications with both the Treasury Secretary and the DSA as necessary, just to let them know you haven&#8217;t forgotten.<br /> This is from the Ex-Scientologist Member Board,  Oct. 1, 2008.  Go here to read the follow-up posts.   <a href="http://www.forum.exscn.net/showthread.php?7903-An-Open-Letter-To-Melbourne-Public&amp;p=150475#post150475">http://www.forum.exscn.net/showthread.php?7903-An-Open-Letter-To-Melbourne-Public&amp;p=150475#post150475</a></p> </div> <div class="meta"> 			Published in: <ul class="post-categories"> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/ex-scientology/" rel="category tag">ex-Scientology</a></li> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/sea-org-or-staff-members/" rel="category tag">Sea Org or Staff Members</a></li></ul>	 	 on August 4, 2011 at 6:22 pm 	&nbsp;<a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/ex-scientologist-story-259-how-to-get-a-refund-in-melbourne/#respond">Leave a Comment</a>	&nbsp;	<br /> 	</div> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/pub/quentin/images/printer.gif" width="102" height="27" class="pmark" alt=" " />  </div>    <div class="post-2028 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-ex-scientology category-sea-org-or-staff-members"> <h2 class="storytitle" id="post-2028"><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/ex-scientologist-story-258-the-underwoods-fight-the-cult-down-under/" rel="bookmark">Ex-Scientologist story #258, The Underwoods fight the cult down&nbsp;under.</a></h2>   <div class="storycontent"> <div id="my-profile"></div> <div><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2030" title="ex-files-scientology21" src="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/ex-files-scientology213.jpg?w=300&#038;h=175" alt=""   /></div> <div></div> <div>From <strong><em>The Times</em></strong>, November 19, 2009</div> <div id="region-content"> <div id="region-body-and-footer"> <div id="region-body"> <div id="region-column1and2-container-layout2"> <div id="region-column1and2-layout2"> <div></div> <h1><span style="color:#333399;">Church of Scientology accused of torture and forced abortions</span></h1> <div id="related-article-links"> <p><strong><em>The Church of Scientology faces the prospect of a police investigation in Australia after being accused of torture and embezzlement and of forcing employees to have abortions.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Nick Xenophon, an independent senator, presented letters to the Australian Parliament from seven former Scientologists which he said showed that the secretive church was a front for physical violence, intimidation and blackmail.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“I am deeply concerned about this organisation and the devastating impact it can have on its followers,” he told the Australian Senate in Canberra.

Ron Hubbard&#8217;s book Dianetics: the Modern Science of Mental Health – together with a large screen showing Scientology advertisements.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>It was an ambitious and costly exercise, but the Underwoods and a colleague put a lot of time and money into the project, signing a lease for 18 months with an option on another 18 months.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Carmel’s husband Tim Underwood explained what went wrong in his letter to Senator Xenophon.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Towards the end of the first 18 months they did not have enough money to take up the renewal option, but the movement wanted them to sign up again.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>As the deadline approached, the couple became increasingly nervous. Although Scientology executives had made it clear the site had to stay, they had not delivered on their promise of a backer – and the Underwoods had been warned off looking for funds from fellow Scientologists.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Finally, as the last 48 hours to deadline slipped away, Tim Underwood faxed Scientology management: unless they delivered on their side of the bargain and found a financial backer, they would not be renewing the lease because they could not afford the payments.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>That was when the real trouble started.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>I was scoffed at, insulted, yelled at…”</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Scientology executives appeared to view his faxed message as an attempt at extortion and summoned all three of them – the Underwoods and their partner in the venture – into the local headquarters, Tim Underwood wrote.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“We were taken into a conference room one by one where we were confronted and interrogated by 11 senior executives…” he continued.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“Judging by the tone and nature of their questioning all present had formed the opinion that we were enemies of the church and must have committed some awful crimes that we were now hiding.”</em></strong></p> <p>As an American I am ashamed of the fact that the evil of Scientology started here and has lasted so long.  However, I think the Australians are tough enough to get rid of the Xenu worshippers.  Anyway, here is my salute to the brave people of that country and to Senator Xenophon for his heroic efforts.</p> <span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='470' height='295' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=AVGxdCwVVULXczKamOoXJhQLH132nIcY6N&#038;hl=en_US' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="meta"> 			Published in: <ul class="post-categories"> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/ex-scientology/" rel="category tag">ex-Scientology</a></li> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/sea-org-or-staff-members/" rel="category tag">Sea Org or Staff Members</a></li></ul>	 	 on August 4, 2011 at 10:51 am 	&nbsp;<a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/ex-scientologist-story-258-the-underwoods-fight-the-cult-down-under/#respond">Leave a Comment</a>	&nbsp;	<br /> 	</div> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/pub/quentin/images/printer.gif" width="102" height="27" class="pmark" alt=" " />  </div>    <div class="post-2020 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-ex-scientology category-sea-org-or-staff-members"> <h2 class="storytitle" id="post-2020"><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/ex-scientologist-story-257-the-bournemouth-horror/" rel="bookmark">Ex-Scientologist story #257, &#8220;The Bournemouth&nbsp;Horror.&#8221;</a></h2>   <div class="storycontent"> <p><a href="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/cthulhu1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2025" title="cthulhu" src="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/cthulhu1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=295" alt="" width="300" height="295" /></a></p> <p>H. P. Lovecraft would have agreed with the title for this post.  Here we see people as victims of a huge ugly monster whose tentacles reach all over the world.  It moves best in the dark where it lurks in the shadows looking for unsuspecting victims.  Once it strikes it will suck the life out of the person, after first taking all of their cash and available credit.  The hideous aspect of this beast is always hidden from the victim.  Sometimes the survivors are left in such a dazed condition they cannot say for sure what happened.  Most of the ones who survive the attacks simply sucrry away and get on with their lives such as they are; some fewer resolve to fight the beast and warn others.</p> <p>Of course we are talking about Scientology; still the allusion to Lovecraft is not out-of-place.  For behind the smiling front put on by empty brained actors and paid shills, the beast of Scientology is as Hideous as any of the Ancient Elder Gods of scary literature.</p> <p><strong>Andrea Catt </strong> left Scientology with her conscience intact.  That led her to seek out the media so that she could expose the truth about what Scientology really is.  Here are some excerpts from The Guardian, 28 November 1996, Page 7.</p> <p>The Guardian, 28 November 1996, Page 7</p> <p><strong><em>FORMER members of the Church of Scientology claim widespread VAT fraud and financial malpractice take place at one of its UK centres, as well as systematic targeting and manipulation of the emotionally vulnerable to extract money. Payments for Scientology courses and books were entered as donations in the accounts to avoid thousands of pounds of value added tax, former members claim.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>They also maintain in The Big Story, to be broadcast this evening on ITV, that Scientology staff helped new members to obtain bank loans under false pretences, to sell assets, to cash in insurance policies and to hand over the proceeds, generating a turnover of about L20,000 a week at the Bournemouth Scientology Mission in Poole.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>The allegations will be a serious setback to the Scientologists&#8217; recent attempts to win respectability. These include a pending application to the Charity Commission for registration as a charity and ITV&#8217;s recent decision to allow them to advertise on television with a campaign on the theme of trust.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>&#8220;We lied to banks, people obtained loans under false pretences. It was whatever we could do to raise money,&#8221; said Andrea Catt, a Scientologist who became registrar at the Bournemouth mission for 1988-95, despite their knowledge of her history of financial malpractice. . . </em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Such large sums from members were routine at the Bournemouth mission, Ms Catt claims. &#8220;People were persuaded to re-mortgage their homes, sell their homes, cash in the policies supposed to pay off their mortgages, borrow against pensions, sell family jewels, borrow from their families, sell their cars. Anything you can possibly imagine that a person could do to raise money, people were persuaded to pay into Scientology.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>&#8220;If a person filled a loan form in saying the money was for Scientology, they&#8217;d get a very negative response so people were encouraged to say that the money was for a management training course, a computer, a car, a boat &#8230; Sometimes we&#8217;d fill them in for them. Then they&#8217;d sign it and it would be submitted to the bank on a completely false basis.&#8221;</em></strong></p> <p>Here follows a video that is well worth watching.  Here the Scientology monster is tracked to its lair.</p> <span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='470' height='295' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLaLZJUzxlo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span> </div> <div class="meta"> 			Published in: <ul class="post-categories"> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/ex-scientology/" rel="category tag">ex-Scientology</a></li> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/sea-org-or-staff-members/" rel="category tag">Sea Org or Staff Members</a></li></ul>	 	 on August 4, 2011 at 8:40 am 	&nbsp;<a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/ex-scientologist-story-257-the-bournemouth-horror/#respond">Leave a Comment</a>	&nbsp;	<br /> 	</div> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/pub/quentin/images/printer.gif" width="102" height="27" class="pmark" alt=" " />  </div>   	<div class="navigation"> 		<div class="alignleft"><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/page/16/" >&laquo; Older Entries</a></div> 		<div class="alignright"><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/page/14/" >Newer Entries &raquo;</a></div> 	</div>  </div>    <div id="menu">  <ul> <li id="calendar"> 	<table id="wp-calendar"> 	<caption>July 2015</caption> 	<thead> 	<tr> 		<th scope="col" title="Monday">M</th> 		<th scope="col" title="Tuesday">T</th> 		<th scope="col" title="Wednesday">W</th> 		<th scope="col" title="Thursday">T</th> 		<th scope="col" title="Friday">F</th> 		<th scope="col" title="Saturday">S</th> 		<th scope="col" title="Sunday">S</th> 	</tr> 	</thead>  	<tfoot> 	<tr> 		<td colspan="3" id="prev"><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2015/06/">&laquo; Jun</a></td> 		<td class="pad">&nbsp;</td> 		<td colspan="3" id="next" class="pad">&nbsp;</td> 	</tr> 	</tfoot>  	<tbody> 	<tr> 		<td colspan="2" class="pad">&nbsp;</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2015/07/05/" title="2015 so far in the press . . . .
