We received an article for our fanzine from an old time science fiction fan and Dianetic &#8220;Clear&#8221; named Jack Harness (for an understanding of &#8220;Clear&#8221; read Dianetics: Modern Science of Mental Health) (more on &#8220;Clear&#8221; below). Jack&#8217;s article was entitled Non-fiction and was a discription of incidents that he said he had remembered from 3 billion years worth of his past lives, with connective material of scenes from the Dianetic &#8220;auditing&#8221; that had allowed him to remember it.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>I thought it was all hogwash. I had known Jack for a short while through science fiction &#8220;fandom&#8221; before receiving his article – we were all members of The Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society – and I thought that if he was clear then Clear was something that I very definitely never wanted to be. Poor Jack struck me as being about as clear as mud.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>But Jim Keith was intrigued and launched into reading every book on or about L. Ron Hubbard [LRH], Dianetics [Dn] or Scientology [Scn] he could get his hands on. About that time our untitled fanzine died and I went to Klamath Falls [K Falls], Oregon [OR] and Jim Keith went to Kansas City [KC], Missouri [MO].</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>By the time I saw him again nearly four years later in K Falls, in 1974, he was a devotee of LRH, had been on staff for a while and had had quite a bit of &#8220;auditing&#8221; (also called &#8220;processing&#8221; or &#8220;pastoral counseling&#8221;). Larry Neilson too had gotten into, and out of, Scn.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Jim Keith moved into my place in K Falls. Just about every day he would go on about his great &#8220;wins&#8221; and the superiority of the &#8220;Tech.&#8221; At first I was still a scoffer, but eventually he got me reading LRH and soon I was hooked.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Jim, Larry and Jack are all now deceased. Jack recently died of old age, Jim broke his knee at Burning Man and died of a blood clot to the lung a few days later – I am convinced it was medical malpractice and/or a &#8220;hit&#8221; that did him in. Larry was the first to go and Jim and I held Scientology partially responsible for his death. Scn does not allow its practitioners to use drugs. And they get rather carried away on this point. The most abject example of this is Larry’s. He was an epileptic. He took drugs to curb this problem. Scn doesn&#8217;t like drugs, and especially what it considers &#8220;psychiatric drugs.&#8221; They ordered him to stay off his anti-epileptic drugs. One day while bathing (in 1984, I think) he had a seizure and drowned. If he had been on his medication he might be alive today.</em></strong></p> <p>Jerry E. Smith spent ten years in Scientology, much of it in the Sea Org.  He gives a detailed account of his time in the cult in his blog.  Much of it is similar to other stories of the Sea Borg we have run across in this series.  The usual lack of sleep, terrible diet, miserable pay, poverty level living conditions and in general, life in a  group where being nice to each other is not considered a virtue.  One thing he mentions that has not received as much attention as it should is Scientology&#8217;s manipulation of the book market in order to, in the end, gain members.</p> <p><strong><em>I once overheard how Bridge Publications, Inc. keeps D:MSMH on the best seller list, and Battlefield Earth too. If either book was not selling particularly well in a given area, BPI sent an order to the local Scn org to have some staff or students go into the B. Dalton&#8217;s or Walden&#8217;s and buy copies. They then shipped the copies back to BPI who in turn shipped them back to their distributors who in turn restocked it in the B. Dalton&#8217;s! Why would they do this, when it certainly would lose a lot of money? Primarily because they know that people are sheep and &#8220;best sellers&#8221; are best sellers because people have heard about them as best sellers and felt compelled to read them; and Scn wants, at all costs, for people to read Hubbard’s books. As Hubbard said &#8220;books are the first line of dissemination.&#8221; The primary route into Scn is: a person buys a book, reads it, gets interested, comes in. BPI might lose $5 on a paperback D:MSMH this way but Scn will make thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of dollars on this &#8220;book buyer&#8221; over the years. Hell, that&#8217;s how Jim Keith and I got in! With sales directly to the Scn orgs it gets even wilder. Since book buyers make up a big percentage of new starts, BPI insures books get sold, or that they, at least, get their stat up. It&#8217;s called a &#8220;cat handling&#8221; (cat for catastrophe). When BPI thinks an org doesn&#8217;t have enough books on stock, or has not been ordering &#8220;enough&#8221; recently, they will invoke a &#8220;cat handling&#8221; and go directly into the bank account of the org, and take out what they want and ship that many books, without asking the org word one about it! More than once while I was there ASHO F could not make some vital payment (like food for the staff or child care payments to the Cadet Org) because BPI had helped itself to ASHO funds.</em></strong></p> <p>The &#8216;Birthday Game&#8221; is a big money-maker for Scientology.  However, with fewer and fewer members to hound for contributions one wonders where it will all end up.</p> <p align="justify"><strong><em>Each year on Ron&#8217;s Birthday the highest stat producers are rewarded with special plaques and Certificates and such. I used to do the calligraphy on many of these. One year the highest stats for any SO Division Six (Public Division) went to ASHO F. At ASHO, the Public Div is actually divided up into three full Divisions, Divs 6A, 6B, &amp; 6C. The Public Executive Secretary [Public Exec Sec or PES] was a guy named Jim Frankel. He was, shall we say, rather creative in how he got his stats reported. All three of his Div 6 Div&#8217;s won First Place as the best (highest stats) Div 6&#8217;s in the SO. Only, in two of the three there was no one posted! Empty, nobody home!</em></strong></p> <p align="justify">This could be said for a lot of cult activities.  These are the people who intend to run the world, yet they are totally inept.</p> <p align="justify"> </div> <div class="meta"> 			Published in: <ul class="post-categories"> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/ex-scientology/" rel="category tag">ex-Scientology</a></li> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/sea-org-or-staff-members/" rel="category tag">Sea Org or Staff Members</a></li></ul>	 	 on August 26, 2011 at 3:55 am 	&nbsp;<a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/26/ex-scientologist-story-277-jerry-e-smith-in-the-cult/#respond">Leave a Comment</a>	&nbsp;	<br /> 	</div> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/pub/quentin/images/printer.gif" width="102" height="27" class="pmark" alt=" " />  </div>    <div class="post-2182 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-ex-scientology category-sea-org-or-staff-members"> <h2 class="storytitle" id="post-2182"><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/25/ex-scientologist-story-274-ten-years-wasted-on-hubbards-balderdash/" rel="bookmark">Ex-Scientologist story #274, &#8220;Ten years wasted on Hubbard&#8217;s balderdash.&#8221;</a></h2>   <div class="storycontent"> <p><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><span style="font-size:xx-small;"> </span></span></p> <div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_2184" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/ex-files-scientology2112.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2184" title="ex-files-scientology21" src="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/ex-files-scientology2112.jpg?w=300&#038;h=198" alt=""   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The cult of greed and bullshit,</p></div> <h1><em><strong>I Wasted About Ten Years on Hubbard&#8217;s Balderdash</strong></em></h1> <p>Thomas Sorensen joined Scientology and was recruited for the Sea Org in Copenhagen.  Worse yet he was put in the GO or &#8220;Guardians Office.&#8221;  This is the nasty, criminal part of the cult that took care of critical reporters, SPs, and of course the agents from the drug companies, psychiatrists, the CIA or whatever paranoid fit they happened to be having at the time. Since this was written the GO was replaced by OSA, the Office of Special Affairs which is just old wine in new skins.</p> <p><em><strong>&#8220;&#8230;the book &#8216;DMSMH&#8217; persuaded me to disregard my own judgment and sanity.&#8221; </strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>I wasted about 10 years on Hubbards balderdash. 1.5 years as a staffmember at the Guardians Office Europe, GOEU&#8230; That made me wake up!</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>So about 25 years later I joined the fray at OCMB, hoping that my evil enturbulating SP&#8217;ness can help stop the fraud.</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>I&#8217;ll just repost my story here:</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>How the hell did I ever buy that shit?</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>This is a rather embarrassing story about me being inexcusably gullible&#8230; Unbeknownst to myself. I didn&#8217;t feel that I was very gullible. To the contrary I viewed myself as an incarnated skeptical. Then and now&#8230;</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>Looking back.. Man! &#8211; I was a cool guy who knew everything back then&#8230; I had &#8216;free will&#8217; and a strong belief in my own cognitive faculties. I&#8217;m not smarter than most people now&#8230; I take it to be the effects of ageing. &#8211; But getting caught up in Scientology! &#8211; Guess I have to admit that I wasn&#8217;t that smart anyway&#8230;</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>Years earlier a good friend of mine had promoted Scientology to me. I was sceptical, but I did the H.A.S (Hubbard Apprentice Scientologist) course. An inexpensive introductory course. This was about 30 years ago&#8230; I can hardly remember.. Doing Training Routines, TR&#8217;s. Other students claiming they went &#8216;exterior&#8217;. I had a feeling like wearing a hat and my head tickling at one time. I was never able to check my hairdo from behind. Trying to lift an ashtray with mindpower&#8230; Telekinesis&#8230; damned ashtray wouldn&#8217;t budge! &#8211; Having it explained to me that I had to have the real &#8216;intention&#8217; of making it do so&#8230; Well&#8230; However. communications and ARC* stuff appealed to me. Made sense.. I used it too..</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>One day there was a recruiting mission from The Guardians Office Europe &#8216;GOEU&#8217; at the Org. I let myself be recruited!</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>Ok.. I knew about the million year contracts of the Sea Org. I took that to mean for life&#8230; Still didn&#8217;t buy that with living forever. Even being drunk like tits, I would never sign a contract for life, let alone one for a million years. The 5 year contract for GO was more reasonable. And I was promised that I could continue my studies for Auditor when I had done staff training. Plus being on Staff I didn&#8217;t have to pay for training. &#8211; It all sounded good.</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>GO orientation was the first course to study. A set of course materials designed to make a new staff member feel welcome&#8230; I&#8217;m being sarcastic here.. Basically it explained to you that anybody could throw you out again if they felt like it. If they thought you were ugly, or for no specific reason at all. I got the impression from it that the GO was paranoid really. The organization as a whole was paranoid&#8230; Oh! &#8211; There was some good reasons for being paranoid given. Policy written by Ron Hubbard said that one in five people were PTS, ie: a Potential Trouble Source, and downright dangerous to have around. Then there was 2 percent of population who were suppressive persons. Those were even more dangerous and sometimes hard to spot because they hid their true intentions. They were the types of Hitler and Caligula. The GO were taking precautions not to get these people on staff.</strong></em></p> <p>Scientologist are always encouraged to spy on each other just like in totalitarian regimes like in the former Soviet Union or East Germany.</p> <p><em><strong>Everyone was supposed to write and send &#8216;Knowledge Reports&#8217; if someone was observed to be out ethics or not doing something they were supposed to do. Maybe they were &#8216;plants&#8217; from government intelligence or undercover reporters out to get us. You were supposed to write commendations too&#8230; The idea was that a persons pile of bad Knowledge Reports and positive Commendations in his ethics file could be compared.</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>The place was reminiscent of an intelligence bureau. Security was tight and felt oppressive. Staff seemed to avoid talking to each other. Apparently personal relations were out security. Telefaxes clattered in a room that was off limits for everyone. Offices were generally off limits, unless you worked there. &#8211; Instant KR (knowledge Report) on Dev. T (Developed unnecessary and disturbing traffic) shot off from the hip if you asked somebody about, I dare say, anything.</strong></em></p> <p>His story is typical of Sea Org paranoia, foolishness and crass ignorance.  Still, it makes interesting reading.   To read the full report go here:  <a href="http://www.lermanet.com/thomas-sorensen/thomas-sorenson.htm">http://www.lermanet.com/thomas-sorensen/thomas-sorenson.htm</a></p> </div> <div class="meta"> 			Published in: <ul class="post-categories"> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/ex-scientology/" rel="category tag">ex-Scientology</a></li> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/sea-org-or-staff-members/" rel="category tag">Sea Org or Staff Members</a></li></ul>	 	 on August 25, 2011 at 1:21 am 	&nbsp;<a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/25/ex-scientologist-story-274-ten-years-wasted-on-hubbards-balderdash/#respond">Leave a Comment</a>	&nbsp;	<br /> 	</div> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/pub/quentin/images/printer.gif" width="102" height="27" class="pmark" alt=" " />  </div>    <div class="post-2168 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-ex-scientology category-sea-org-or-staff-members"> <h2 class="storytitle" id="post-2168"><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/24/ex-scientologist-story-271-forced-abortions-in-scientology/" rel="bookmark">Ex-Scientologist story #272, Forced Abortions in&nbsp;Scientology.</a></h2>   <div class="storycontent"> <p><a href="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/hail-xenu.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2169" title="Hail-Xenu" src="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/hail-xenu.jpg?w=212&#038;h=300" alt="" width="212" height="300" /></a></p> <p>The number of Scientologists in New Zealand is very small, less than a couple of hundred.  But when it comes to ruining lives and making scandals size really does not matter.  The following is an excerpt from the &#8220;Christchurch Press,&#8221; dated February 2, 2009.</p> <p><strong><em>If that was a fork in the road, Genny Long went the other way. She was 16 and living in Christchurch. It was the 1970s and her boyfriend&#8217;s family ran the Church of Scientology franchise here &#8212; within the clerical language that Hubbard is said to have adopted largely for tax purposes, the office in Christchurch is known as a &#8220;mission&#8221;. </em></strong><br /> <strong><em>So she dabbled in Scientology, beginning with a communications course. She says now that she had trouble talking to her parents &#8212; typical teenager &#8212; and this helped. It was basic general knowledge &#8212; listening and not interrupting, keeping your cool in an argument. But in her naiveté, Long thought these were techniques that Hubbard had invented.</em></strong><br /> <strong><em>It was quickly beneficial. She began to feel superior to her parents and others. &#8220;We were encouraged to feel that we had information and knowledge that they didn&#8217;t have,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We were encouraged to put ourselves above them. That makes you feel good. That&#8217;s the hook.&#8221; </em></strong><br /> <strong><em>She went into auditing next, following the procedures set out in Hubbard&#8217;s founding volume, Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. It was only recently, doing a psychology paper at university, that she realised these ideas weren&#8217;t wholly original either. </em></strong><br /> <strong><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s a trap for young players, not having that information and that knowledge.&#8221; </em></strong><br /> <strong><em>Her boyfriend became her first husband. They went to Sydney and worked in the Scientology centre there. She trained as an auditor and kept searching her own mind and past for the causes of things that ailed her. Once you exhaust your immediate memory, you move into experiences at birth, in the womb, past lives.</em></strong><br /> <strong><em>Like the way she tried to cure her asthma. As she spiraled through past lives, she concluded that she had been a soldier in a war, gassed by an enemy. So the asthma is a psychosomatic reaction to that old trauma &#8211; problem solved.</em></strong><br /> <strong><em>&#8220;You feel so elated and floating,&#8221; she says. &#8220;You write a success story and say: my asthma is cured, I&#8217;ve found my initial engram. But that night, you start wheezing.&#8221;</em></strong><br /> <strong><em>And there is another side to a cure that doesn&#8217;t take. The church says that if auditing doesn&#8217;t work, you must have &#8220;undisclosed crimes&#8221; &#8212; negative feelings about Hubbard and Scientology. And you will need to do sessions on those. </em></strong><br /> <strong><em>It&#8217;s all so Orwellian. Accusations of thought crimes. Show trials of those who are’t performing. As an auditor, she was encouraged to get her statistics up &#8212; increasing chargeable hours, essentially &#8212; and if she didn&#8217;t she must be &#8220;actively suppressing&#8221; statistics. Those found to have thought crimes wore grey armbands and were kept away from others as untouchables. </em></strong><br /> <strong><em>This part started to worry her. She had been on staff for nearly five years, and was tired and pregnant, when it clicked: was she really happy or was everyone else happy? So she and her husband resolved to get out.

This showed that she was at the C.I.N. 3 stage, the worst on a scale of three: while she did not necessarily have cancer, she nevertheless needed further treatment as soon as possible.</p> <p>O’Brien knew she had two options. One was to have an immediate biopsy, with follow-ups every six months; the other was to have a hysterectomy, an operation in which her womb would be removed, which of course meant she would be unable to have any more children.</p> <p>“I knew the CofS [Church of Scientology] methods of encouraging abortions so the thought of having any more children was unlikely,” she wrote.[2]</p> <p>“I thought I had no choice, being a staff member of the CofS … to settle for the…hysterectomy.”</p> <p>It was not just Scientology’s policy on having children that affected her decision; she made it clear that their failure to finance basic medical had also played a role.</p> <p>“I also knew I would never be able to afford an operation every six months and certainly would not be assisted by the CofS financially or medically,” she wrote.</p> <p>But she could not even afford the 5,000 dollars for the hysterectomy.</p> <p>Two of her superiors made it clear they would not finance the intervention – they even advised her against having it, she wrote: “…they both disapproved of having any sort of having any sort of operation or surgery at all, to handle the cancer.”</p> <p>She eventually came to an arrangement with the doctor by which she repaid the cost of the operation by doing an architectural rendering of his home (O’Brien is a trained architectural designer).</p> <p>According to O’Brien, this was not the only time Scientology’s management ignored a serious, or potentially serious medical situation.</p> <p>“There were three other CofS staff members diagnosed with Cancer when I was there… One continued to work at his desk until he died. There was no support or palliative care at the CofS, although there was a medical officer… not medically trained.</p> <p>O’Brien said her final two years inside the Sea Org were spent on its Rehabilitation Project Force (RFP) a punishment programme for those members deemed to have failed to live up to the movement’s ethical standards.</p> <p>The level of medical neglect there was if anything even worse, she wrote.</p> <p>“On the RPF I was concerned about a bedridden elderly staff member who had cancer, who had seeping open chest wounds that needed to be cleaned and bandages change daily.</p> <p>“Somehow I made time to do this for her, and even put up some curtains and cleaned her room.”</p> <p>O’Brien was put on an even tougher programme as punishment for having put up curtains in the women’s dormitory: this was considered “idle” behaviour. She heard later that her bedridden colleague had died.</p> </div> <div></div> <div>To read more go here: <a href="http://infinitecomplacency.blogspot.com/2010/01/9-peta-obriens-letter-medical-neglect.html">http://infinitecomplacency.blogspot.com/2010/01/9-peta-obriens-letter-medical-neglect.html</a></div> <div></div> <div><span style="font-family:Arial;"><strong>Scientology:<br /> Scientology&#8217;s dark secrets<br /> BARNEY<br /> ZWARTZ<br /> The Age<br /> November 21, 2009   </strong></span></div> <div> <div><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Here is a link to this story which mentions Peta and others. </span></span></p> <div><strong><a href="http://www.cifs.org.au/dark.php">http://www.cifs.org.au/dark.php</a><br /> </strong></div> <h3>Update 2/15/12  Here is Peta giving her insights on the RPF.</h3> <span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='470' height='295' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/78XZEPOhptA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span> </div> </div> <div></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="meta"> 			Published in: <ul class="post-categories"> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/ex-scientology/" rel="category tag">ex-Scientology</a></li> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/rpf-victims/" rel="category tag">RPF victims</a></li> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/sea-org-or-staff-members/" rel="category tag">Sea Org or Staff Members</a></li></ul>	 	 on August 19, 2011 at 7:55 pm 	&nbsp;<a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/19/ex-scientologist-story-269-medical-neglect-abuse-in-the-rpf/#respond">Leave a Comment</a>	&nbsp;	<br /> 	</div> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/pub/quentin/images/printer.gif" width="102" height="27" class="pmark" alt=" " />  </div>    <div class="post-2127 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-ex-scientology category-rpf-victims category-sea-org-or-staff-members"> <h2 class="storytitle" id="post-2127"><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/19/ex-scientologist-story-268-enslaved-by-the-cult-as-a-boy-more-rpf/" rel="bookmark">Ex-Scientologist story #268, Enslaved by the cult as a boy.

Ron Hubbard. John Lindstein says he was kept &#8220;busy, poor, tired, and uninformed&#8221; by Church of Scientology leader David Miscavige at the church&#8217;s ranch in Hemet, and feared that &#8220;things would get even worse if he did not work as ordered.&#8221; </em></strong><br /> <strong><em>     Lindstein&#8217;s Superior Court complaint alleges human trafficking and violations of hour and wage laws at the church&#8217;s &#8220;Gold Ranch&#8221; compound near Hemet, a semirural area east-southeast of Los Angeles.</em></strong><br /> <strong><em>     Lindstein says that from 1990 until 2006, starting when he was just 8 years old, he &#8220;performed this work as a virtual slave, working 16 to 24 hours days with no sleep, no time off and no personal freedom&#8221; at Gold Base, a mysterious and once-secret headquarters that &#8220;resembles a prison camp,&#8221; with razor wire, security guard patrols, surveillance posts and three roll calls each day.</em></strong><br /> <strong><em>     By age 16, Lindstein says, he was working for Golden Era Productions, Scientology&#8217;s film production company, restoring Hubbard&#8217;s films from the 1970s. He says he often worked 24-hour days at the &#8220;tedious, frame-by-frame work that would normally cost more than $400,000 per movie to accomplish at industry rates.&#8221; </em></strong><br /> <strong><em>     Lindstein and his crew of five were paid $50 per week, he says.</em></strong><br /> <strong><em>     Lindstein says Miscavige and others &#8220;intentionally, consciously and wrongfully made a tactical decision to ignore labor laws, take [their] chances with a compliant and intimidated work force, and hope that the running of the statute of limitations would in the long run save [them] millions of dollars.&#8221; </em></strong><br /> <strong><em>     Lindstein says that Miscavige &#8220;runs the Scientology enterprise with an iron fist, according to his own rules, and enjoys the lifestyle and job benefits of royalty while those at the bottom of the food chain live like slaves and inmates.&#8221;</em></strong><br /> <strong><em>     Those who tried to escape from Gold Ranch and were caught were assigned to the &#8220;Rehabilitation Project Force,&#8221; in which workers faced &#8220;a brutal regime of manual labor, have no freedom of movement and are subjected to almost total deprivations of personal liberties,&#8221; according to the complaint.</em></strong><br /> <strong><em>     Church of Scientology spokeswoman Karin Pouw said the church would not comment on the allegations.</em></strong><br /> <strong><em>     &#8220;The complaint filed by John Lindstein against the Church of Scientology International and others has not been served,&#8221; Pouw said. &#8220;We do not comment on cases to which we are not a party.&#8221;</em></strong><br /> <strong><em>     In his complaint, Lindstein says he was eventually &#8220;pushed to his breaking point and he found a way out.&#8221; </em></strong><br /> <strong><em>     He says he has since been &#8220;declared an enemy of Scientology, given a large illegal bill for his purported scientology training, and cut off from friends and family who are still under the control of the Scientology enterprise.&#8221;</em></strong><br /> <strong><em>     Lindstein wants the church to pay him at least minimum wage for his years of work.

Membership is not restricted to service on the ships.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Hubbard declines to appear publicly to answer questions about his organization. . .</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Writing for a penny a word is ridiculous. If a man really wanted to make a million dollars, the best way to do it would be to start his own religion.”</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Lafayette Ronald Hubbard tossed off this remark at a lecture in Newark N.J., in 1949. At the time Hubbard was 38 years old, a prolific science fiction writer advising science fiction buffs on the tricks of his trade. The audience laughed.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Hubbard and church leaders contend that he has resigned from the church’s directorship, but that resignation seems to have made little difference. In a “policy letter” dated Sept. 1, 1966, the matter was ambiguously worded. Hubbard said that he was “resigning the title of executive director” and was being given the title of “Founder” instead. In his statement, Hubbard said that his services had been voluntary for some time but that church organizations had owed him “considerable outstanding sums” and should pay up.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Hubbard’s authority in the church is unchallenged. He keeps in constant communication, sending a steady stream of directives, orders and policy letters to the organizations, and the units report to him weekly. And Scientology messages made available to the Past-Dispatch show that he receives money from the church – lots of it.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>After the 1968 difficulties in England, Hubbard made himself commodore over a fleet of four ships and headed toward the warm Mediterranean. He declines to give any interviews and has been secluded for more than six years from the press, critics and followers.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>The Sea Organization is Scientology‘s aristocracy. Hubbard’s daughter, Diana, lieutenant commander, says that the Sea Organization is “the most powerful organization in the world.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Details of the Sea Organization operations and rumors of Hubbard’s opulent life aboard the ship have been difficult to document because of tight security maintained by Scientology. In recent months, however, a former member of the Sea Organization, John McLean of Toronto, Canada, has provided the first inside account of Scientology‘s shipboard life. McLean, 21 years old, was third mate on the Apollo when he quit in disillusionment.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“After I became third mate and began getting confidential data, I realized the Church of Scientology is power and money-hungry,” he told the Post-Dispatch in a lengthy interview.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“Third mate is in charge of personnel placement, internal communication and ethics, or discipline, of everyone on board. I was in direct communication with Hubbard,” he said.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>McLean says that there are 300 crew members and “they are compelled to do things by fear. I was scared of getting kicked off my job, or transferred to a lousy post, or made to do amends (punishment) projects. Fear is very, very strong. Hubbard wrote a book about it. He’s almost a master of fear.”</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>McLean describes Hubbard as about 65 years old, short and fat, weighing about 250 pounds. He has no teeth and is often sick. He is given to wild mood swings. “Hubbard has the best of everything possible aboard a ship,” McLean said. “He has cars, three motorcycles, a stereo system, the best food and clothing, a cook, a valet and a private suite of rooms.” His wife Mary Sue and some of his children, Diana and her husband, John Horwich; Quentin, 19; Suzette, 17, and Arthur, 13, live on the Apollo.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>McLean had been in Scientology only a few months when he was recruited for the Sea Organization – an honor for a Scientologist. It is the family equivalent to a Catholic son joining the priesthood. McLean’s mother was a staff member and an ordained minister at the Toronto Church of Scientology. She recruited another son, Bruce, and his wife, Dawn, for the Toronto staff. Her husband, Eric, a former Royal Canadian Air Force officer, began taking Scientology courses. The family has since left Scientology.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>John McLean was an honor student in grade 13 at Sutton West, Ontario, near Toronto. He dropped out of high school to join the Sea Organization. McLean boarded the flagship Apollo at Tangier, Morocco, on Feb. 19, 1971. He rose quickly to third mate in May 1972, and left the ship Nov. 9, 1972.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>The Sea Organization, McLean said, has a fleet of four ships: The Apollo. The Athena, which sails near Copenhagen, and the Bolivar and Excalibur, both sailing near the west coast of the United States.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>During the time McLean was on board, the Apollo sailed in a triangular circuit starting at Tangier, then to Casablanca, Safi and Agadir, all in Morocco, to the island of Madeira and on to Lisbon and Faro, Portugal.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>The Apollo doesn’t practice Scientology openly, McLean said. It has a cover organization, Operation and Transport Corporation, Ltd., a company registered in Panama. OTC Ltd. is supposed to train people from affiliated organizations in business management.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“It’s really everyone from the individual Scientology organizations that comes to the ship to train in Scientology technology,” McLean said. “No one but Scientologists are to live aboard. But officials in the Moroccan and Portuguese governments believe the ship is a management training company.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“One of my jobs was keeping tight security. When some official came aboard there was a clean ship drill. Anything on the walls to do with Scientology was taken down, books and papers were hidden and various packs written for the occasion were brought out. These packs deal with business management. A new person on board was not allowed to go ashore until he passed a test about the cover story, so he couldn’t give away the fact we were Scientologists. Crew members were not supposed to talk or have anything to do with Scientology while ashore.”</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“For nine months after I left the ship, I didn’t work. Emotionally, I was not stable enough to do anything but try to stop Scientology from attacking my family. I was under a doctor’s care and on tranquilizers.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“Now,” he said, “I’m better. I’m off the tranquilizers. But my life is still not back to normal. I’m still being harassed. My family is being sued for $1,000,000 for a television program we did about Scientology.

I worked as a Swedish translator at Pubs DK in Copenhagen. I left the SO and the CofS in October 1977 with the firm intention never to return. I have since been living a fairly happy and productive wog life.</p> <p>In the early 80s I received demands from the CofS that I repay my &#8220;free-loader debt&#8221;. I figured out that, since this is a debt that is accumulated over a period of one billion years, it can also be paid back over a period of one billion years, so I agreed to pay it in installments of 0.05 Swiss Francs every one thousandth year. The CofS wasn&#8217;t exactly happy with this solution, but I also wrote an article about it which I managed to get published in a Swedish magazine. Since then, the CofS has left me virtually alone. (There were a couple of feeble attempts to make me accept &#8220;amnesties&#8221;, but this was also in the 80s.) I haven&#8217;t even had to think about Scientology since then (frankly, I have lost all interest in the subject).</p> <p>However, quite recently, the CofS seems to have decided that I have no more urgent wish in life than to rejoin and &#8220;come back on lines&#8221;. A few months ago, I began getting phone calls from somebody in Copenhagen. I told him I am not interested (I even asked him to look up the word &#8220;not&#8221; in a good dictionary and then use it in a few sentences, until he understood the word &#8211; to no avail, of course). Finally, I got so fed up with this that I disconnected my phone (I was going to change to using a mobile anyway, but this hastened my decision to do so).</p> <p>As if this were not enough, in the beginning of June I received a letter from the Director of Income at AOSH Europe together with a statement of my &#8220;free-loader bill&#8221;. The accompanying letter told me &#8220;one very good data from LRH is that communication can solve any problem&#8221; and that &#8220;I will try to help you as much as I can and I think you also can help me&#8221;. Obviously the girl thinks that making financial demands that would ruin me for life, if I took them seriously, is &#8220;helping&#8221; me.</p> <p>I have reported both those matters to the police in Copenhagen, but I have not received an answer yet.</p> <p>So what I wonder is if anybody on this forum has some advice as how I should go about getting those people off my back.</p> <p>This was posted on the Ex-Scientologist Member Board.  To read it and the follow-up statements go here.  <a href="http://www.forum.exscn.net/showthread.php?12694-Introducing-myself/page2&amp;highlight=samuelsson">http://www.forum.exscn.net/showthread.php?12694-Introducing-myself/page2&amp;highlight=samuelsson</a></p> </div> <div class="meta"> 			Published in: <ul class="post-categories"> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/ex-scientology/" rel="category tag">ex-Scientology</a></li> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/sea-org-or-staff-members/" rel="category tag">Sea Org or Staff Members</a></li></ul>	 	 on August 11, 2011 at 9:45 pm 	&nbsp;<a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/11/ex-scientologist-story-264-how-to-repay-the-freeloaders-debt/#respond">Leave a Comment</a>	&nbsp;	<br /> 	</div> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/pub/quentin/images/printer.gif" width="102" height="27" class="pmark" alt=" " />  </div>    <div class="post-2082 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-ex-scientology category-sea-org-or-staff-members"> <h2 class="storytitle" id="post-2082"><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/ex-scientologist-story-263-kevin-g-brady-another-family-hurt-by-the-cult/" rel="bookmark">Ex-Scientologist story #263, Kevin G.

Brady posted a message to his children on the <strong><em>Scientology Disconnection </em></strong>site, here are some excerpts:</p> <p><strong><em>&#8220;There is a lot I would like to say about my children who endured the Sea Org for 12 and 13 yrs of their lives. It took me three years to get them out after I myself left &#8211; three years of fear and threats and lies. I&#8217;m only sorry I didn&#8217;t succeed when I originally left. I could have stopped the cadet org abuse from ever occurring. I found out after my children had grown how they were beaten and sexually abused while in the Cadet org. I wish I had known. For everything that happened to them &#8211; at the beach when they were forcefully taken from me &#8211; to their stint in the Cadet org in PAC I am so truly sorry. They won&#8217;t talk about that time in their lives. I don&#8217;t blame them. I won&#8217;t go into details &#8211; many things happened and many are bad. They are free and they are living their lives happily now. For that I thank God!&#8221; Ozzie</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>&#8220;My Son, I am sorry for the neglect I subjected you to while I was on staff. You deserved my love and care, instead you received ethics handlings and fear. Please forgive me.&#8221;</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>&#8220;I was going through a very serious crisis, and concerned that I might be dangerous to myself and others, and the Church fed this idea by declaring me a &#8220;Suppressive Person&#8221;. I was compliant with this, and decided it would be best for you if I left, and if I didn&#8217;t insinuate myself into your lives. I thought it would be best for you if I cut the cord&#8230; Nitza, I recently watched the movie &#8220;Hard Problems&#8221;, and it was wonderful to see you again, even if through a movie camera. Zeb, I&#8217;m very proud of you for your success, and glad to see that you have remained the person I remember so well from your early years, although you&#8217;ve obviously grown a lot and deepened into the man you&#8217;re becoming. Gabby, what can I say. A daughter is famously the apple of a father&#8217;s eye, and you are no exception, for me. I am very sorry for my poor judgment being involved with that Church, and words cannot express how sorry I am that you paid the price for my ignorance and poor judgment when I was a teen parent.&#8221; Kevin G.
