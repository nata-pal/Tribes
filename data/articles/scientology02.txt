Ron Hubbard.  He was in hiding at the time but thought if he could control the negative information against him the way would be open for him to return to living openly in society.  This program was known as &#8220;Snow White.&#8221;  But as usual Scientology proved to be inept, this time at spying, and the whole house of cards came down on top of Mary Sue Hubbard and the rest of her office; she and some of her underlings ended up in federal durance vile while Hubbard stayed in hiding.</p> <p>Part of this spy  were Ford and Andrea Schwartz.  They have long since parted with Scientology so this tale is of more historical interest than anything else.  Their targets were the big ones; Michael Flynn the attorney who sued the cult on behalf of a number of former members and Paulette Cooper, a journalist that Scientology was trying to get either thrown in prison or mental institution, depending on which dirty plot worked.  Some of the story you will find here:</p> <p><a href="http://www.rickross.com/reference/scientology/videos/video3.html">http://www.rickross.com/reference/scientology/videos/video3.html</a></p> <p>and here you will find Andrea giving a generalized view of Scientology: <a href="http://www.icsahome.com/logon/elibdocview.asp?Subject=Leaving+Scientology+%96+Exit+or+Detour%3F">http://www.icsahome.com/logon/elibdocview.asp?Subject=Leaving+Scientology+%96+Exit+or+Detour%3F</a></p> <p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center;

he tells how to get a refund from the Melbourne Org.  After reading this you understand why it is so hard on the local Scientology orgs to refund money.  They have already sent money uplines, which will never come back, and they have spent the rest of it on the usual expenses.  So in order to pay the money back they must first take it in.  If everyone who had money on account in Melbourne wanted the money back that was still unused for services, hell, it would bankrupt them!!</p> <p><a href="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/topbdayplayer1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2040" title="TopBDayplayer" src="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/topbdayplayer1.jpg?w=470" alt=""   /></a></p> <p><strong>AN OPEN LETTER TO MELBOURNE PUBLIC</strong></p> <p>In the interests of disclosing that which the church wont disclose, and helping those the church wont help (its own public) I want to explain to you some points on the church&#8217;s public accounts system. That is the money that you, the paying public (and paying staff members) have put onto their own accounts at the Church of Scientology. Generally, this advice is applicable to all orgs, but as I was on staff in the Treasury Division at the Melbourne org I can talk specifically about Melbourne.</p> <p>Some back ground data on me. My name is Scott Bradley. I was, until earlier this year, the Director of Income at the Melbourne Day org. If you are still onlines there then you may have heard some black PR regarding the reasons for me no longer being there. The church can say what it likes. I will present you some facts about me just so you may put any black PR you have encountered into contact with some truth, and decide for yourself what sort of person I am.</p> <p><strong>THE CURRENT SCENE</strong></p> <p>The current scene at Melbourne Day is that they have $1 million approximately in undelivered services. This means that over the decades they have been in operation they have collected this money but never delivered the services being paid for. This also means that the money still, legally, belongs to the public who put that money onto their account. It does not belong to the church. These are referred to as advanced payments. I am not talking about money already spent by having received services or materials.</p> <p>In the first few months of this year, whilst I was still on staff, the Melbourne Day org refunded approximately $40,000 of advanced payments. It took several months each time, as the Org has to obtain that money anew before they can refund it. When the org originally receives it, they allocate it per LRH policy at the weekly FP meeting. Percentages go to Int Management via Flag. Promotion is funded. Bills are paid. And if it is a reasonably good week then staff are paid. Money is also put aside into a reserve account, and into a CVB account. CVB stands for Claims Verification Board. It is from this account that refunds are paid. However, as mentioned above Melbourne has $1,000,000 liability, but they most certainly do not have $1,000,000 in their CVB account (closer to $5,000 or $10,000). They have spent that $1,000,000 in operational costs. In other words, the public who have yet to recieve most of their services have been funding the operation and survival of the Melbourne org. I would think that it is the case in most orgs around the world.</p> <p>So, in my experience, the org does refund. Especially if it gets onto the DSA&#8217;s lines. It just doesn&#8217;t do it immediately, as it doesn&#8217;t have the funds available.</p> <p>Now, what if a significant percentage of these monies paid for services as yet undelivered were requested refunded by the public? It would have a serious negative impact on the Melbourne org. And remember, it isn&#8217;t their money in the first place. Not until they have delivered the services.</p> <p>So if you are, or have ever been a public at the Melbourne org, you may actually have funds sitting on account doing nothing. It is still yours.</p> <p><strong>HOW TO FIND OUT IF YOU HAVE FUNDS ON ACCOUNT AT THE MELBOURNE ORG</strong></p> <p>First thing you want to do is request an &#8220;Account Statement&#8221; from the Treasury Secretary &#8211; Greg Peart. An Account Statement lists out money on account. You may also want to request an &#8220;Account History&#8221;, and list the time period you want this for. This lists out all the individual transactions related to your account &#8211; &#8220;Credits&#8221; = money paid onto account, &#8220;Debits&#8221; &#8211; money used from account, to pay for services or materials. The computer system has been operational since 1996. All account details from before this period is in the hard copy files. The data still exists and is available.</p> <p>When you confirm if you have money on account with Melbourne Day (or Foundation &#8211; two seperate orgs), next step is to write a letter requesting this money to be refunded as you no longer wish to recieve Scientology services. Write to the Treasury Secretary (Greg Peart), and CC (carbon copy) to DSA (Mary Anderson). Make sure to CC to the DSA. The Treasury Secretary will be concerned only about the financial impact that your refund request has on the Org, but the DSA will be primarily concerned about the negative PR, and legal, affect your request will have. The DSA will want you handled and sent on your way asap. Use these two opposite dynamics to your advantage.</p> <p>Give it at most about two weeks to hear back from the Treasury Secretary about what his plans are for refunding you your money. Remember at all times &#8211; it is YOUR money. Expect it to take a month or more, depending on how much you are requesting. If you have $20,000 or more then you should allow a few months realistically. But keep in communications with both the Treasury Secretary and the DSA as necessary, just to let them know you haven&#8217;t forgotten.<br /> This is from the Ex-Scientologist Member Board,  Oct. 1, 2008.  Go here to read the follow-up posts.   <a href="http://www.forum.exscn.net/showthread.php?7903-An-Open-Letter-To-Melbourne-Public&amp;p=150475#post150475">http://www.forum.exscn.net/showthread.php?7903-An-Open-Letter-To-Melbourne-Public&amp;p=150475#post150475</a></p> </div> <div class="meta"> 			Published in: <ul class="post-categories"> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/ex-scientology/" rel="category tag">ex-Scientology</a></li> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/sea-org-or-staff-members/" rel="category tag">Sea Org or Staff Members</a></li></ul>	 	 on August 4, 2011 at 6:22 pm 	&nbsp;<a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/ex-scientologist-story-259-how-to-get-a-refund-in-melbourne/#respond">Leave a Comment</a>	&nbsp;	<br /> 	</div> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/pub/quentin/images/printer.gif" width="102" height="27" class="pmark" alt=" " />  </div>    <div class="post-2028 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-ex-scientology category-sea-org-or-staff-members"> <h2 class="storytitle" id="post-2028"><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/ex-scientologist-story-258-the-underwoods-fight-the-cult-down-under/" rel="bookmark">Ex-Scientologist story #258, The Underwoods fight the cult down&nbsp;under.</a></h2>   <div class="storycontent"> <div id="my-profile"></div> <div><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2030" title="ex-files-scientology21" src="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/ex-files-scientology213.jpg?w=300&#038;h=175" alt=""   /></div> <div></div> <div>From <strong><em>The Times</em></strong>, November 19, 2009</div> <div id="region-content"> <div id="region-body-and-footer"> <div id="region-body"> <div id="region-column1and2-container-layout2"> <div id="region-column1and2-layout2"> <div></div> <h1><span style="color:#333399;">Church of Scientology accused of torture and forced abortions</span></h1> <div id="related-article-links"> <p><strong><em>The Church of Scientology faces the prospect of a police investigation in Australia after being accused of torture and embezzlement and of forcing employees to have abortions.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Nick Xenophon, an independent senator, presented letters to the Australian Parliament from seven former Scientologists which he said showed that the secretive church was a front for physical violence, intimidation and blackmail.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“I am deeply concerned about this organisation and the devastating impact it can have on its followers,” he told the Australian Senate in Canberra.

Although Scientology executives had made it clear the site had to stay, they had not delivered on their promise of a backer – and the Underwoods had been warned off looking for funds from fellow Scientologists.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Finally, as the last 48 hours to deadline slipped away, Tim Underwood faxed Scientology management: unless they delivered on their side of the bargain and found a financial backer, they would not be renewing the lease because they could not afford the payments.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>That was when the real trouble started.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>I was scoffed at, insulted, yelled at…”</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Scientology executives appeared to view his faxed message as an attempt at extortion and summoned all three of them – the Underwoods and their partner in the venture – into the local headquarters, Tim Underwood wrote.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“We were taken into a conference room one by one where we were confronted and interrogated by 11 senior executives…” he continued.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“Judging by the tone and nature of their questioning all present had formed the opinion that we were enemies of the church and must have committed some awful crimes that we were now hiding.”</em></strong></p> <p>As an American I am ashamed of the fact that the evil of Scientology started here and has lasted so long.  However, I think the Australians are tough enough to get rid of the Xenu worshippers.  Anyway, here is my salute to the brave people of that country and to Senator Xenophon for his heroic efforts.</p> <span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='470' height='295' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=AVGxdCwVVULXczKamOoXJhQLH132nIcY6N&#038;hl=en_US' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="meta"> 			Published in: <ul class="post-categories"> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/ex-scientology/" rel="category tag">ex-Scientology</a></li> 	<li><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/category/sea-org-or-staff-members/" rel="category tag">Sea Org or Staff Members</a></li></ul>	 	 on August 4, 2011 at 10:51 am 	&nbsp;<a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/ex-scientologist-story-258-the-underwoods-fight-the-cult-down-under/#respond">Leave a Comment</a>	&nbsp;	<br /> 	</div> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/pub/quentin/images/printer.gif" width="102" height="27" class="pmark" alt=" " />  </div>    <div class="post-2020 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-ex-scientology category-sea-org-or-staff-members"> <h2 class="storytitle" id="post-2020"><a href="https://androvillans.wordpress.com/2011/08/04/ex-scientologist-story-257-the-bournemouth-horror/" rel="bookmark">Ex-Scientologist story #257, &#8220;The Bournemouth&nbsp;Horror.&#8221;</a></h2>   <div class="storycontent"> <p><a href="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/cthulhu1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2025" title="cthulhu" src="https://androvillans.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/cthulhu1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=295" alt="" width="300" height="295" /></a></p> <p>H. P. Lovecraft would have agreed with the title for this post.  Here we see people as victims of a huge ugly monster whose tentacles reach all over the world.  It moves best in the dark where it lurks in the shadows looking for unsuspecting victims.  Once it strikes it will suck the life out of the person, after first taking all of their cash and available credit.  The hideous aspect of this beast is always hidden from the victim.  Sometimes the survivors are left in such a dazed condition they cannot say for sure what happened.  Most of the ones who survive the attacks simply sucrry away and get on with their lives such as they are; some fewer resolve to fight the beast and warn others.</p> <p>Of course we are talking about Scientology; still the allusion to Lovecraft is not out-of-place.  For behind the smiling front put on by empty brained actors and paid shills, the beast of Scientology is as Hideous as any of the Ancient Elder Gods of scary literature.</p> <p><strong>Andrea Catt </strong> left Scientology with her conscience intact.  That led her to seek out the media so that she could expose the truth about what Scientology really is.  Here are some excerpts from The Guardian, 28 November 1996, Page 7.</p> <p>The Guardian, 28 November 1996, Page 7</p> <p><strong><em>FORMER members of the Church of Scientology claim widespread VAT fraud and financial malpractice take place at one of its UK centres, as well as systematic targeting and manipulation of the emotionally vulnerable to extract money.

These include a pending application to the Charity Commission for registration as a charity and ITV&#8217;s recent decision to allow them to advertise on television with a campaign on the theme of trust.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>&#8220;We lied to banks, people obtained loans under false pretences. It was whatever we could do to raise money,&#8221; said Andrea Catt, a Scientologist who became registrar at the Bournemouth mission for 1988-95, despite their knowledge of her history of financial malpractice. . . </em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Such large sums from members were routine at the Bournemouth mission, Ms Catt claims. &#8220;People were persuaded to re-mortgage their homes, sell their homes, cash in the policies supposed to pay off their mortgages, borrow against pensions, sell family jewels, borrow from their families, sell their cars. Anything you can possibly imagine that a person could do to raise money, people were persuaded to pay into Scientology.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>&#8220;If a person filled a loan form in saying the money was for Scientology, they&#8217;d get a very negative response so people were encouraged to say that the money was for a management training course, a computer, a car, a boat &#8230; Sometimes we&#8217;d fill them in for them.

and others to claim that the current madness of Scientology is all the fault of David Miscavige and that in the days of L. Ron Hubbard things were so much better.  That of course is pure crap.  Scientology was just as insane a group in the 1960&#8217;s as it is now.  The big difference is the present speed of information and the fact that journalists and other opinion leaders (and those who just have big mouths)  in society now know what a silly con the cult of Xenu is.  Scientology has always acted like a bunch of adolescent monkey-spankers who are incapable of doing anything than causing misery to others.</p> <p>Roger Boswarva tried hard to grow and flourish by using Hubbard&#8217;s various systems.  And up to a point he was succesful.  But the leaders of the various orgs as well as their bosses in the command chain are not big on success.  They want miserable, caved-in, vacant eyed victims to punish and exploit.   This story is also interesting as it shines some light on the era of &#8220;Snow White&#8221; and the fiasco that sent Mary Sue Hubbard and others to federal prison.</p> <p><strong><em> In July 1968, International Life Insurance Company, a client of mine, had 10,000 salesmen throughout the UK, and the company wanted me to repeat the magical performance of sales training using my old PE lecture and Comm Course materials throughout the company. I was so successful, four attendees on my first course went into the org for more services while actually on my sales training course.</em></strong></p> <p>Learning I was doing these courses (perfectly on policy and in tech) the twits in the org wrote to my client telling them the action was not sanctioned by them, a “violation of their copyright” and that they would be sued if they persisted.</p> <p>You would have thought they’d have given their eye-teeth for 10,000 new bodies in the shop . . . . not that bright!</p> <p>What is even more stupid, this brilliance by me of scaring the org with 10,000 demanding new public actually earned me being assigned the newly released condition of Treason . . . then the lowest condition assignable. You’d have thought they’d see me as a hero! Hell no!</p> <p><strong><em>The Church of Scientology, now, is a sick organization totally introverted into “finding enemies” but which enemy situation is a fantasy of its own delusion and making. It does not and cannot apply its technology in a manner that produces optimum results, but only produces more upsets, problems, difficulties and duress for its people. It is totally fixated on making others wrong, and “handling” them as enemies after it itself has fantasized that enmity into being. And it does this with its own people. And hence, it is declining and losing its supporters and believers.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Its greatest crime, and lie, is the falsehood that it is “the only way out,” that it has the route to total freedom and is the only group to have it.

My husband &amp; I ran across Scientology for the first time in Los Angeles in 1978, shortly after our marriage. We took a couple of Scientology courses and dropped it &#8211; he thought the amount of money they wanted was insane, and I objected to the control they seemed to want to exert over our lives.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Fast forward twenty years. It is now late 1998 and my husband has developed cancer &#8211; for the second time. He recalls that Scientology claims to address a mind-body connection underlying illness and goes into Buenaventura Mission in Ventura, California, where &#8211; vulnerable and distressed by the cancer &#8211; he is quickly recruited into Scientology with promises that they can &#8220;help.&#8221;</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>My husband began doing Scientology courses and auditing in early 1999, and the Mission immediately began pressing him for money. And then more money. And then more money.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Throughout 1999, my husband was drawn deeper and deeper into Scientology, and their pressure for money ratcheted up &#8211; including demands that we drain retirement accounts, max out credit cards, etc. As long as he believed that Scientology might help him avoid a recurrence of cancer, I didn&#8217;t feel I should oppose it. So I watched, with growing dismay, as their demands for his time and money increased.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>My husband began urging me to join Scientology. I said that, although I wouldn&#8217;t object to his involvement with Scientology as long as he believed it was helping him health-wise, I had no interest in it for myself. It was very unlike him to pressure me to do anything &#8211; throughout our marriage we had supported and encouraged each other &#8211; never pressured. And yet he began pressuring me intensely to just try Scientology; just take a course or two.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>What I didn&#8217;t know was that Mission staff were telling him that, unless he could persuade me to join Scientology, he would have to divorce me. Even though I was not opposing his involvement with Scientology, they apparently saw me as a &#8220;Potential Trouble Source&#8221; and it was either recruit me or leave me.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>In late 1999, to keep peace in the house, I agreed to try Scientology. For the next six months, I took courses and did auditing at Buenaventura Mission. The hard-sell pressure for money never let up.</em></strong></p> <p>At this point Mary Ann called out for help and found some takers.  Jesse Prince, Stacy Brooks and others gave her information and moral support.  Both Mary Ann and her husband walked out of the org with a refund check in hand.  To find out more about the Scientology practice of disconnection go here and read the stories.  <a

hounded for money to the point of throwing Scientology sales people out of his house after midnight, he came to the conclution that is was all they wanted was his money. </p> <p>His story is recounted in the wonderful blog infinite Complacency by UK journalist Jonny Jacobsen.  Her are some of the more pertinent parts:</p> <p><strong><em><strong>“Scientology promises salvation from the life/death cycle,” wrote Mackey</strong>, explaining the incentive.  He had been taught that he was “an immortal being with personal power that would rival the characters of Greek mythology…”</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>The OT levels are supposed to unlock these godlike powers – though former members who have done these levels have dismissed these claims as nonsense.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“Once on and committed to attaining the spiritual freedom promised from OT VII we were bilked for another 820,000 to 900,000 [Australian] dollars between us,” he wrote.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>They were to spend the next 15 years trying to get through that level.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>In 1993, Mackey flew to Florida, reputed to be one of Scientology’s top centres, to learn how to do the solo auditing he would need for this level.  </em></strong><strong><em>Auditing is Scientology’s version of counselling, or therapy, when the subjects go over their past – and their past lives – to discover what is blocking their spiritual development.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>But unlike the lower levels, when you are audited by another Scientologist, those on the upper levels are expected to audit themselves.  And in the six weeks he was in Florida he paid more than 35,000 Australian dollars to learn how to do this.  For the next three years he went through the designated exercises several times a day, as required, and flew to Florida every six months for check-ups costing 800 dollars a day.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Those checks included confessional sessions in which he was expected to own up to any transgressions.  </em></strong></p> <p><strong><em></em></strong><br /> <strong><em>Hard sell</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>At the time, he thought it would take just a few years to get through OT VII.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>But then in 1996 the movement suddenly released revised versions of all its training levels “… and we were told to return and retrain as we had been doing it all wrong.  </em></strong><br /> <strong><em>“This was at our expense.”  At the same time, Mackey noticed a significant change in the way the training was delivered.  From what had been just a couple of hours, the mandatory six-monthly confessional sessions now lasted much longer: sometimes up to 36 hours.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>One of Scientology’s “ethics officers” filed what was known as a “knowledge report” summarising the “crimes” that had been uncovered during the confessional.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>And if the offences were considered sufficiently serious, the member concerned would be expected to make amends, wrote Mackey.  As time went on these amends increasingly became donations of cash to the Church,” he added.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Offences could include failing to perform the daily training, taking alcohol or watching pornography.  Those who had looked at critical material about Scientology or given a less than glowing account of their experiences in the movement were seen in a particularly poor light, wrote Mackey: these offences carried heavy penalties.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>He recalled one Scientologist, a widowed mother of twins, being forced to hand over 60,000 dollars for having failed to lock away her worksheets properly after a session.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Also during this period, it became compulsory to get involved with all of Scientology’s various organisations, he

organisation for businesses run by members of the movement. And every one of them wanted a piece of the action, wrote Mackey.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“Some of these groups would ask for donations of up to $100,000 and if they sense any weakness of resolve would push until the parishioner would sell their house if they required&#8230;”</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>When they felt there was money to be made, the different Scientology organisations would work together to get the maximum amount out of a parishioner, wrote Mackey.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“I know of several people who were coerced into giving up inheritances and pushed to the point of bankruptcy from these actions, which the Church calls ‘reg cycles’.”</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Nor were these hard-sell operators restricted to Florida, he added.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“I have had teams… come uninvited to my home and have to be forcibly thrown out after midnight.” That had happened on at least four separate occasions, he added.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“My wife and I were persuaded to donate around $200,000 Aus from the early nineties in this manner,” he wrote.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“After 1996 I endured another 12 years of OT VII…” and Scientology’s “capricious and relentless efforts to defraud us of our money,” he added.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>The IAS would call them regularly to tell them they needed more money to fight the mandatory drugging of school children “…by the evil psychiatrists or defeat Nazi Psychs who were behind the German government’s dislike of the Church…”</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>The IAS even likened Germany’s campaign to the Nazi-era persecution of the Jews.  So they handed over 80,000 US dollars.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Why they stood for it</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>In his letter, Mackey tried to explain how financially independent public members of Scientology could allow themselves to be subjected to this kind of abuse.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>“When one begins in Scientology there is nothing weird or space alien about it,” he wrote.  </em></strong><br /> <strong><em>“One learns to resolve conflicts, work more efficiently, live without the use of drugs or alcohol, communicate more clearly and study better.”</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>For a troubled newcomer, wrote Mackey, Scientology would be seen as Godsend.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>But he added: “Once you have taken the bait and become hooked, the real Scientology is presented, very slowly, over the years. It slowly becomes the only chance the human race or indeed the whole universe has.”  That, and the promise of the powers to be unleashed on the OT levels, helps explain why the paying Scientologists paid over such vast sums of money, he added.</em></strong></p> <p>Here is Kevin Mackey and others at a hearing before a committee of the Australian government. </p> <span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center;
