Joe aan de dood ontsnapt</h2> 								De afgelopen dagen was Justin te vinden in Sydney, Australië. Hij was daar onder andere met Joe Termini. Zij kwamen daar vooral om een kerkbijeenkomst bij te wonen. Daarna verbleven ze op een luxe jacht.  Van te voren werd er gezegd dat rif haaien niet aanvallen, dus zij zijn gewoon het water ingegaan om te zwemmen. Ineens werd Joe aangevallen door een haai. De haai hapte in zijn borstkast en ribben. Gelukkig was Justin toen al uit het water om te helpen. Justin postte een foto op Instagram met als titel: "Exactly why i hate sharks they told us reef sharks don’t bite @joetermini" Gelukkig is het allemaal goed gekomen.  <a href="http://www.justinbieber.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a8ntrdj93bsc_md.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-696 size-full" src="http://www.justinbieber.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a8ntrdj93bsc_md.png" alt="a8ntrdj93bsc_md" width="790" height="783" /></a> <a href="http://www.justinbieber.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tumblr_nqzq5dseoj1qhft5ko1_r4_500.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-698 size-full" src="http://www.justinbieber.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tumblr_nqzq5dseoj1qhft5ko1_r4_500.jpg" alt="tumblr_nqzq5dseoj1qhft5ko1_r4_500" width="500" height="500" /></a> <a href="http://www.justinbieber.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tumblr_nqzhzmTdkn1qhft5ko1_r1_500.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-697 size-full" src="http://www.justinbieber.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tumblr_nqzhzmTdkn1qhft5ko1_r1_500.png" alt="tumblr_nqzhzmTdkn1qhft5ko1_r1_500" width="500" height="667" /></a>							</figcaption> 						</figure> 						<div class="read_more"> 							<a href="http://www.justinbieber.nl/justin-joe-aan-de-dood-ontsnapt/" title="Justin &#038; Joe aan de dood ontsnapt"><em class="icon_more"></em>Lees meer</a> 						</div> 					</article> 										<article class="news nomarginmobi"> 						<figure> 							<div class="image"> 								<a href="http://www.justinbieber.nl/justin-op-bijbelkamp/" title="Justin op bijbelkamp?"><img alt="Justin op bijbelkamp?" src="http://www.justinbieber.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Justin-Bieber-2.jpg"></a> 							</div> 							<figcaption class="text"> 								<h2>Justin op bijbelkamp?</h2> 								Dat Justin veel liefde heeft voor zijn geloof is wel bekend bij iedereen. Dat liet hij zojuist nog even merken, toen hij werd gespot in Sydney voor bijbelkamp! Justin heeft, zoals we allemaal weten, de afgelopen tijd heel wat zonden begaan. Maar daar heeft hij dan ook zeker van geleerd. Na de Bieber Roast in april, was het helemaal afgelopen en liet hij zijn fans weten dat Justin zijn leven wilt verbeteren.  De Hillsong Church staat helemaal in het teken van muziek. Niet gek dus, dat Justin voor deze kerk gekozen heeft. Vorig jaar waren er meer dan 20.000 deelnemers uit ruim 60 landen tijdens de bijeenkomst. Nu nog afwachten tot Justin de rest van de wereld heeft overtuigd van zijn goede gedrag, maar Justin, wij geloven al in je!							</figcaption> 						</figure> 						<div class="read_more"> 							<a href="http://www.justinbieber.nl/justin-op-bijbelkamp/" title="Justin op bijbelkamp?"><em class="icon_more"></em>Lees meer</a> 						</div> 					</article> 										<article class="news noright_margin"> 						<figure> 							<div class="image"> 								<a href="http://www.justinbieber.nl/where-are-u-now/" title="Where Are Ü Now"><img alt="Where Are Ü Now" src="http://www.justinbieber.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CInApw0UkAEJQAv.jpg"></a> 							</div> 							<figcaption class="text"> 								<h2>Where Are Ü Now</h2> 								Het nummer "Where Are Ü Now" van Jack Ü (Skrillex &amp; Diplo) ft.

Zo hadden wij ook de gelegenheid om hem eventjes te spreken. Ik vroeg of hij mee ging met Justin Bieber naar Fusion Fest in Birmingham en hij zei dat die hoogstwaarschijnlijk ook mee ging. Ook vroegen we hoe het met Justin ging en hij vertelde dat het erg goed gaat en dat Justin momenteel druk bezig is in de studio. We kijken er erg naar uit!
