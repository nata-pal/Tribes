That&#8217;s changing. Will they ever get all their memories back?”</p> <p>Answer: There are no plans to have the characters fully regain their memories.  Well, except under very specific circumstances.  But that&#8217;s a story for another season&#8230;</p> <p>Alisa Scott writes: &#8220;could it be possible that 2 is part of the federation &amp; they had her genetically enhanced”</p> <p>Answer: Federation?  You have us confused with <em><strong>Star Trek</strong></em>.  I think you mean the Galactic Authority.  Is it possible?  Sure.</p> <p>LasseOleBosse writes: &#8220;Are there any plans for a Blu-ray release of Dark Matter Season 1 yet?&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: Alas, DVD releases are out of my jurisdiction.  My sphere of influence extends to scripts and lunch orders.</p> <p>Glenda writes: &#8220;Will we ever find out who shot at the ship, in the first episode?&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: Eventually, yes.  Who fired at the ship.  Who deleted the ship&#8217;s data stores.  And, most importantly, who wiped their memories.</p> <p>CraigLivesHere writes: &#8220;If the crew of the Raza are wanted criminals with their pictures/photos being broadcast all over “TV”, how is it that no one recognizes them when they dock at the space stations?&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: For starters, it&#8217;s a big galaxy and while their faces may be recognizable to members of the Galactic Authority, they are the stuff of legend to much of colonized space&#8217;s civilian populations (note the miners&#8217; take on The Raza back in Episode 101).  The space stations they had are independent entities, some hosting unsavory travelers just as notorious as our lovable anti-heroes, making it easier for them to blend in and go unnoticed.</p> <p>Fecrabond writes: &#8220;Do your ideas for scripts come naturally or was their training involved?&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: I&#8217;ve been sitting on this project for quite a while and, in that time, have had the opportunity to really flesh out the character backstories, their world &#8211; and a five season game plan.</p> <p>&#8220;Also, can we expect any kind of pets for the raza crew?&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: No definite plans but Jodelle Ferland has requested a cat for her character, FIVE.</p> <p>bambamfans writes: &#8220;1. Judging from your blog posts, it seemed like the cast and crew of Dark Matter bonded quickly, much like the Stargate days. What did you do to achieve this?&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: I can&#8217;t take credit for the friendships that have formed.  We were just fortunate enough to cast some very talented, very good people.</p> <p>&#8220;2. The show is heavily serialised. Do you think there’s a trend towards more serialised TV, as opposed to procedurals?&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: There is a definite trend toward more serialized show.  Back when I was working on SG-1, the emphasis was on standalone episodes.  Now, people are looking for long, involved story arcs with plenty of twists and turns.</p> <p>&#8220;3. Dark Matter is extremely well cast with strong performances from all of the main cast and an array of awesome guest stars throughout the season – David Hewlett, Wil Wheaton, Ruby Rose, Torri Higginson, Jessica Sipos, Ennis Esmer and Jon Cor. What were the performances that really stood out for you?&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: I can&#8217;t single out a specific performance.  All the actors you mentioned were a delight.</p> <p>&#8220;4. The production shot some days on location in Hamilton, Ontario. How did this compare to the forest locations near Vancouver during the Stargate days? Any bear or other wildlife stories?&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: No bears &#8211; just more warehouses and A LOT colder weather.</p> <p>&#8220;5. Cloning has become a reality on the show. It’s only been experimental in our lifetime but do you foresee it being used in other capacities?&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: Uh, sure.  You can have your dog cloned in South Korea for about $100 000.</p> <p>&#8220;6. Name one surprising thing you learned about 2 members of the main cast on Dark Matter.&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: Anthony Lemke was a lawyer before dedicating himself to acting.  Roger Cross is a professional poker player.</p> <p>&#8220;7. Can you give one dialogue tease from an upcoming episode?&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: &#8220;But truth is, when the time comes that you do decide to leave, I&#8217;m gonna miss you kid. I&#8217;m gonna miss you a lot.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;8. What can fans do to give Dark Matter the best chance of a second season, apart from watching the show live? Is tweeting SyFy OK or is it better to write?&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: To be honest, tweeting, emails, and letter writing campaigns don&#8217;t do much to influence the network.  If you can&#8217;t watch it live, then record and watch it the next day.</p> <p>Lulu S. writes: &#8220;Why hasn’t Five told anyone about how she entered the Raza? Or has she and I missed it?&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: No, she hasn&#8217;t.  Probably because she hasn&#8217;t had the opportunity to tell anyone &#8211; or seen the advantage in doing so.  After Episode 6, events proceed at a rapid pace.  There&#8217;s very little downtime between episodes leading up to the finale.</p> <p>Mark4 writes: &#8220;Why are you looking for a new agent? Isn’t an agent supposed to find you work? You already have a job, don’t you? Or is there something we Dark Matter fans should know?&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: Who knows what the future holds?  Nothing is definite and I want to be prepared for any eventuality.  Keep in mind, the show still hasn&#8217;t been picked up.</p> <p>ceresis64 writes: &#8220;I think these questions make sense – but no promises! And apologies, if they’ve been posed before&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: Great questions but all of the answers would be major spoilers.  Answers to all these questions coming in the episodes ahead &#8211; and season 2.</p> <p>FuturaSG writes: &#8220;Can you promise you’ll work on Dark Matter for as long as it airs. The show is your baby and, like you said in a recent blog, you’ve set up a bunch of stuff you’re going to pay off. How can someone else step in and try to do the same thing. Guess?&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: As much as I&#8217;d love to work on the show through the entirety of its run, that&#8217;s something I can&#8217;t promise.  Season One was a lot of fun and, as long as I&#8217;m enjoying myself, I will continue to write and produce <em><strong>Dark Matter</strong></em>.</p> <p>Ponytail writes: &#8220;HOW IS LULU?????&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: Lulu is still suffering from the same issues.  She seems really rundown of late.  Her endoscopy suggests inflamed bowel disorder.  Awaiting the results of another test.</p> <p>dasndanger writes: &#8220;Joe, did you see Guardians of the Galaxy?&#8221;</p> <p>Answer: I did see &#8211; and enjoyed &#8211; Guardians of the Galaxy.  Hmmm.  I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s time our resident film critic, Cookie Monster, caught up on his reviews.  I feel a &#8220;My Top 10 Superhero Films&#8221; blog entry percolating.</p> <div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled"><div

I think my question about how/who came up with the Transit Transporter idea must have been too early.

I hope they figure out what&#8217;s going on soon and she gets better.</p> <p>Yes, I miss Cookie Monster!   Make sure he gives us a little advance notice to pre-watch the movie too!

A pain in the butt but I&#8217;m using hubby&#8217;s mega computer until mine is repaired.  Windows 10 seems very similar to Windows 7.  </p> <p>Getting back to clones.  Did you know that the bananas we eat are clones?  Here&#8217;s a link to a short history about bananas:  <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/032610_bananas_clones.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalnews.com/032610_bananas_clones.html</a>  I was talking to a professor friend of mine about this.  He thinks that is why banana candy doesn&#8217;t really taste like bananas.  Maybe it tastes like the previous banana?  He says there a colony of the original version of bananas somewhere (can&#8217;t remember where) and it&#8217;s on his bucket list to try this banana.  </p> <p>Do you have banana soda?  </p> <p>{{{Hugs}}} to Lulu!

The proper way to drink soda in the South is to fill your glass with ice and pour the drink over.  We NEVER drink warm soda.  </p> <p>The traditional Southern sodas are Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew and Big Red, though.

And, having read a previous comment I did go to the Apple Store and picked up the series. I am pacing my self of as to end watching the previous episodes by the time the season ender arrives. I am not a chat room type of person so I do not know if it has been discussed or mentioned, but the beginning title sequence reminds me of a character of a previous show. The lettering reminds me of &#8220;Replicators.&#8221; Not sure if you agree so hard to ask if it was a conscious or unconscious decision.  Speaking of pick up I did send a letter to SyFy Hq. asking for a second season.<br /> I guess my favorite characters on the show are turning out to be Three and Six. I like Two but, man, is she one manipulator!? She looks very good in black, but then I was reflecting on this show and others.

Then again I&#8217;ve mostly visited Dallas when in Texas and not much else.</p> 			<br style="clear: both" /> 		</div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> 	</ol>  	<div class="navigation"> 		<div
