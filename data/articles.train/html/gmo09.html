 Photo by Tom Wills</em></p> <p><strong>Princess Beef: The New Generation</strong></p> <p><em>By Thomas Wills</em></p> <p>It is a pleasant July evening at Cynthia and Ira Houseweart’s Princess Beef ranch on Rogers Mesa just a couple miles west of Hotchkiss. It has been raining in town and the Valley to the east just minutes earlier and air wafting across the pastures smells clean and fresh.  A small group of us have gathered for a tour of the Rogers Mesa portion of the Princess Beef operation organized by the Valley Organic Growers Association.</p> <p>Princess Beef cattle are raised to general organic and natural standards and are Animal Welfare Approved, a certification that Cynthia is particularly proud of.  She explains that the designation insures that the cattle were humanely raised and slaughtered at levels well beyond the general requirements for the terms organic or grass-fed and grass-finished. The pasture raised/grass finished part is particularly important.  It means that the cattle were never fed unnatural diets high in grains such as corn (which many times is GMO) or fattened in an unsanitary feedlot where they would need antibiotics to ward of diseases cause by the bad environmental conditions.</p> <p>The Princess Beef herd spends their entire lives on pasture as if they were a natural wild ruminants, contented, socializing, and because Cynthia spends a lot of time with them, very friendly and curious about us visitors. The herd on the Rogers Mesa ranch, on this evening, is on the lower end of a large grass pasture where a view of the North Fork of the Gunnison canyon winds below us with the soft slopes of Scenic Mesa beyond. The cows spot the approaching visitors and began to gather in a half circle line around us. Cynthia talks about the ranch standing between the two groups, cattle and humans, both seeming very attentive to her words.</p> <p>Princess Beef actually is a part of two ranches; the historic Centennial Houseweart Ranch on Rogers Mesa and the Steve and Rachel Allen Ranch on Fruitland Mesa. Princess Beef began when Cynthia was gifted by Steve and Rachel with a cow named Princess. But a couple years before that Cynthia, fresh out of college with a degree in art history in the early 1990’s, was looking to have some adventures. One such adventure was to go on a real cattle drive. A classmate invited her to such a drive on her family’s 2,000 acres ranch near Crawford and there the adventure became a life and career that had not much to do with art but a lot to do with history. The cattle drive, before which Cynthia had never even been on a horse, became a job on the Allen’s Ranch, where the Princess Beef herd began. Then as the business progressed as did her partnership with the Allens, she met the veterinarian’s son, Ira Houseweart, also just out of college and developing business of his own in artistic metal fabrication. They married and now have two daughters who are growing up, with doting parents, among a menagerie of goats, chickens, pigs, friendly cows, swimming ponds and a hundred year of local family history. Cynthia and Ira have built and are growing a very sustainable local business, or several interrelated businesses, that fits with the new Valley economics.</p> <p>Seeing Cynthia Houseweart for the first time you would take her as a born ranch woman cut of the same mold as her open, friendly mother-in-law, Betty. Both women, whip-smart and strong, seem to fit the landscape.  Cynthia is a new breed of cowgirl, educated and willing to blend the best of the old with new knowledge, mentored by the Allens in holistic management and setting new example for local cattle operations, one that is as revolutionary as the one that has taken place over the last quarter century in the fruit industry.  Growing naturally and cleaner and more ethically and selling directly to consumers when you can.</p> <p><a href="http://www.merchantherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Cows-princess-Beef-2015.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5464" src="http://www.merchantherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Cows-princess-Beef-2015.jpg" alt="Cows - princess Beef 2015" width="576" height="324" /></a></p> <p>Cynthia talks about grass and pasture management with a passion, describing how natural grazing of hay fields improves the soil.  The Rogers Mesa Princess Beef fields take up about 120 acres including 30 acres of leased ground stretching from the J Road headquarters south to the railroad.  The pasture is electric fenced into flexible paddocks where the cows are kept only long enough to eat a portion and add back positive fertilizers back before being moved to the next pasture.  Like natural animals use patterns there is no overgrazing damage here. The pastures are lush and healthy.</p> <p>She explains that the Princess Beef mother herd of 60 cows and this year’s crop of calves are grazing on the Allen’s Fruitland Mesa Ranch. The cattle on the pastures of the Roger’s Mesa Ranch are mostly last year’s calves, now about 15 months old, who will find their way into freezers across the state this fall.  Freezers of very satisfied customers who previous contracted to buy a whole or portion of a beef knowing they could trust how the animal was raised, humanely and naturally, all on pasture so that the carbon footprint of these cows is more like a bison of 1700’s rather than a modern agri-business bovine fed on soy protein and corn, which required huge inputs of fossil fuels resulting in significant CO2 outputs.</p> <p>And what’s a year like for Princess Beef? The calves start to come about the middle of March mostly at the Allen Ranch unless there might be a problem with a specific young mom, in which case she might be brought down to the headquarters to watch more closely. When weaning time comes they do something unique, they separate the cows and calves when they have matured enough (about 7 months) but, instead of the usual moving them far out of each other’s sight, Cynthia and Ira just create two separate side by side pastures separated by an electric fence, calves on one side and moms on the other. Thus, continuing nursing is prevented, but the trauma to mom and child is minimized. This transition last about a month when the youngsters graduate, about December, to the lower pastures of the Houseweart Ranch where they remain to the following fall along with any moms who are not getting pregnant.
