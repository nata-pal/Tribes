With this action, private enterprises are being encouraged – and coerced – by special interest groups into selectively denying services to individuals or groups of individuals who are involved in an activity which these special interest groups find both repulsive and morally offensive.   So with this decision to deny services to a specific group of individuals based on a moral or ethical belief system, let’s go back a few months to the State of Oregon and their discrimination case against <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/02/sweet-cakes-by-melissa-fined-same-sex-wedding_n_7718540.html?utm_hp_ref=gay-voices&amp;ir=Gay+Voices">Sweet Cakes by Melissa</a>.   In this case, the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries ruled that the bakery owners, Aaron and Melissa Klein, were guilty of discriminating against gay couples in the daily operation of their private business and ordered the defendants to pay $135,000 in damages to lesbian couple, Rachel Bowman-Crye and her wife, Laurel Bowman-Crye.  In the proceedings, the Kleins had argued that same-sex marriage was against their Christian beliefs; and they felt that they should not be force to provide service for a ceremony which they found morally offensive to their Christian values. After the OBLI ruling against the Kliens, Labor Commissioner <a href="http://www.bradavakian.com/"><strong>Brad Avakian</strong></a> <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/gresham/index.ssf/2013/08/lesbian_couple_refused_wedding.html">stated</a>, &#8220;The goal is never to shut down a business. The goal is to rehabilitate.”   And across the nation, the courts are consistently ruled on the side of gay rights in the vast majority of these types of discrimination cases.  The current trend is: non-discrimination trumps moral values.   But don’t look for someone like Oregon’s Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum or Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian to step in and take up Doctor Palmer’s cause.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">How does Cecil’s death mesh with the Left’s view on “Death with Dignity”?  Euthanasia is the ailing grandmother to abortion rights to the Progressive mind.  The right to die with dignity falls within the branch system of the Pro-Choice family tree.  The Left views both the unwanted fetus and the nonproductive senior as parasites – leeches feeding off the back of a productive society.  Considering the reality that the average life expectancy of a male lion in the wild is just ten to eleven years, the fact that Cecil was still master over his pride at the ripe old age of thirteen is rather amazing.   Perhaps outside influences from park rangers or the international research consortium observing the daily routine of the lion family assisted Cecil in maintaining his throne.  Unlike older female members who are allowed to remain at the pride’s dinner table until they die a more dignified death, the old King is disgraced and driven from the pride when a younger male lays claim to the pride.  If the old King isn’t killed in the battle for the throne, he is most likely mortally wounded.   There is no Senior Center for displaced lions on the open savannah; the environment is an inhospitable place for an old male now trying to survive on his own.  The old guy has many enemies seeking to even the score.   Within a matter of weeks, if not days, the big cat will have either died a slow agonizing death by starvation; or an equally horrendous death by a revengeful attack by a vicious hyena, jackal, or wild dog pack.  Mauled, shredded, and eaten alive by the ravenous pack there is no dignity in this old fellow’s death.  A much more humane death would be found in the form of a bullet.  In a controlled situation where prides are monitored and displaced senior males identified, safari hunters, or park rangers, would be allowed to bring down these regal animals with a more dignified death.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Never Let a Good Crisis Go to Waste:  The Battle Cry of the Left!  Liberals live for a good crisis.  Nothing can shove your agenda to the forefront and enhance acceptance by the American public like the confusion surrounding a tragic event on the national or international scale.  Doctor Palmer was the perfect scapegoat for this calculated scheme.   The tactic: As quickly as possible have the left wing internet bloggers and the national media go to work and highjack the story; present or distort the facts in a manner which will be favorable to your cause.  Toss the real story to the side and start fresh; building the agenda-driven narrative model from the ground up.  Twist the plight of the victims – or even who the true victims may be &#8211; to a position where the event draws unfavorable attention to one or more of your more despised conservative causes!   Quickly demonize the antagonist, or the source which has brought pain to your chosen victim, and show how their actions could have easily been prevented had your enemies not opposed your corrective policies.  Next; if the victims are no longer of any value in furthering the cause, push them aside and out of focus in your newly generated story.  Set your primary focus on the destruction of the antagonist and the conservative cause to which you’ve associated his name and negative actions.  Don’t let up!  Beat your version of the story into the minds of the American public until they have eaten the storyline which you’ve spoon fed them, spewed it back in the face of the conservative cause, and embraced your newly fabricated champion which hopefully results in attaining implementation of your carefully crafted change of policy – with the blessing of an ignorant people.  So we now have a beloved leader, lured from the safety of his pride, and shot down with a rifle needlessly in the prime of his life by the Great White Hunter too cowardly to face the great monarch – man to beast.  The actions of this invader placed the safety of the pride’s youth in peril and the rule of order in question.  The world demands justice for Cecil and the pride.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">But what about the Symbols of Oppression and Male Dominance Which the Left Wants to Bring Down?  If ever there was a symbol of male dominance and oppression, it is the image of the male lion.  His actions are swift!  His decisions unquestioned!  And his authority unchallenged!  But Cecil the Lion is much like ol’ Joe Biden!  He may have stepped on a few toes and patted a few young ladies’ rumps on his way to the top; but he’s not like the rest of his gender.  We can use him!   Ignore the fact that Cecil killed his predecessor’s male offspring when he assumed control of the pride.  Ignore the fact that he defeated, humiliated, and drove off any young newcomers who challenged his authority.  Ignore the fact that he found a shaded haven from the heat of the afternoon sun while the women of the pride ventured out risking life threatening injury for the sake of the evening meal for the pride.  And after running down and killing the prey, watch as the stately monarch lumbers out of his safe haven to claim first choice at the dinner table.  But elevating the image of Cecil, though terribly flawed and a true symbol of oppression in a feminist world, can be twisted to serve your purpose.  Just as many hold that the Confederate flag and monuments to Southern Civil War heroes are symbols of oppression, the Left ignores the racist stance and vehement support of segregation across the nation by the Democratic Party up through the mid 1960’s, and ignores the memorial tributes to men such as Robert Byrd, Lyndon Johnson, Woodrow Wilson, Hugo Black, and countless other Democratic lawmakers who only changed their segregationist views after it was no longer politically advantageous to support them.   Rest assured that if there was political hay to be made in support of the Confederate Battle Flag and Southern Civil War heroes; Wasserman, the Clintons, Pelosi, Reid, and even Obama would be proudly sporting their Stars and Bars lapel pins in front of the American public with every scripted press conference.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">And finally, the Black Lives Matter movement.  Lions, male and female, die every day on the African savannah.  Lions killing lions!  Water buffaloes killing lions!  Elephants killing lions!  African citizens killing lions!  These daily killings go unnoticed and unreported by the media- mainstream and social.  Largely because the general population does not care.   There are far too many other events which have a more direct influence on their lives and well-being.  But when the Great White Hunter takes down one of these stately and defenseless beasts, the cry for justice goes out.  And someone must pay for This senseless loss of life!  This lion had a future!  This lion was targeted just because he was a lion!  If rumored fangs were flashed and a supposed roar sounded, it was only in defense!  Statistics show that these creatures are targeted, incited to attack, and then shot from behind as they flee their tormentor.   The death of This particular lion draws the attention of activist groups, the national media, and liberal internet bloggers.  This lion cries out for justice – while the circumstances surrounding all of the other dead lions gets swept under the rug and ignored. Meanwhile, 40 million unborn black babies are thrown into the medical waste bins of the abortion clinics across the nation.  Rival black gang members kill one another along with their innocent victims in inner-city drive by shootings.  And of the surviving black children born out of wedlock, most are neglected by their biological fathers and left to find male guidance from street gang leaders or neighborhood disciples of Nation of Islam head Louis Farrakhan.  Black lives do matter!  Not the dead which some hope to capitalize on!  But the living!  The unborn just moments from their death on the abortionist table.  The forgotten teens on the streets of the inner city ghetto.   The frightened children captive in the inner city public school system.  All black lives matter.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">And while the story of Cecil the Lion still has legs and will probably live on until Doctor Palmer is turned over to a pack of ravenous jackals to be eaten alive.  And a grandiose bust of Cecil is commissioned by the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations by an internationally renowned sculptor.  And Barack Obama and other world leaders gather and pay a stirring tribute to Cecil the Lion for his contributions to mankind and the animal world at his international memorial service in Geneva.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Animal rights groups and their followers have certainly found more value in a dead Cecil than a live one.  Had he died a normal death on the African savannah, his passing would have gone unnoticed?  The Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU) at Oxford University would have continued to struggle financially- in obscurity. In the secret places where their true thoughts are revealed, they whisper a prayer of thanks to the old lion who wandered out from his protected sanctuary.  And to Doctor Palmer for taking that regrettable shot.</p> 											</div><!-- .entry-content -->   					<div class="entry-utility"> 						This entry was posted in <a href="http://www.popknowseverything.com/category/general-topic/" rel="category tag">General Topic</a> and tagged <a href="http://www.popknowseverything.com/tag/black-lives-matter/" rel="tag">Black Lives Matter</a>, <a href="http://www.popknowseverything.com/tag/cecil-the-lion/" rel="tag">Cecil the Lion</a>, <a href="http://www.popknowseverything.com/tag/symbols-of-oppression/" rel="tag">Symbols of Oppression</a>.
